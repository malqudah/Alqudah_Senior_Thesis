Rajiv is an amazing preceptor, although I suspect Irina and Vinit are also great (they are helpful during OH). Not sure that the class actually ended up covering much material - a long time was spent on various forms of least squares, integer, and linear programming, but the surface was just scratched with some of these. Psets are easy (only 3 questions, 4 hours of work max). The midterms are conceptual, you can never be sure of what to expect.

The graders grade pretty harsh for homeworks in that they won't tell you everything they ask for in the question to get full credit and you have to guess what they want (should go to office hours and ask them if what you wrote is enough to get full credit for every question).

       "3   Prof. Stellato and the AIs were all extremely caring and helpful people. They were helpful in talking through concepts at Office Hours, and set up additional time to meet and discuss concepts as necessary. The lecture slides are good, actual lecture tends to be an exact rehashing of the slides. Precepts are extremely valuable for problem solving. Rajiv is an amazing preceptor, although I suspect Irina and Vinit are also great (they are helpful during OH). Not sure that the class actually ended up covering much material - a long time was spent on various forms of least squares, integer, and linear programming, but the surface was just scratched with some of these. Psets are easy (only 3 questions, 4 hours of work max). The midterms are conceptual, you can never be sure of what to expect. The final is not too difficult, the entire 24 hours to work on it is generous. Grade distribution is very generous (45% of class gets some form of an A)   \n",

Prof. Stellato is a pretty good lecturer, although he may skip over the fundamentals of the more difficult concepts in the second half of the course, so be prepared to use outside resources to fully understand the material. The graders grade pretty harsh for homeworks in that they won't tell you everything they ask for in the question to get full credit and you have to guess what they want (should go to office hours and ask them if what you wrote is enough to get full credit for every question). Professor and instructors are pretty dedicated to teaching the course and are responsive to emails. Overall, a pretty good and interesting course.   \n",

It is a great introduction to optimization and the course staff is very helpful in teaching. Lectures aren't totally necessary, but I went to all lectures and found them really helpful in understanding the material. P-sets are only 3 questions a week and very doable (go to OH!!). Also, the in-class exams are very difficult but your grade will likely be fine in the end. Great ORF course, will take more optimization in the future!   \n",

The homework/psets are extremely manageable and Prof. Stellato is great! Exams were slightly hard but the grading policy was very generous. Even if you are not in ORF, if you are in any technical field, the skills you learn are pretty useful, and I found them interesting.   \n",
