Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This class is a must-take. It can become difficult at times, but the questions on the problem sets are some of the most rewarding challenges I have ever worked on. I always found myself arriving at an ""aha"" moment when I finished one, and they somehow never felt tedious. I was always engaged, and Professor Adams was amazing at presenting the material in a succinct and clear manner. This class only further sparked my interest in machine learning and I am beyond excited to continue learning.",,
"If you're feeling a bit insecure about your math skills (particularly linear algebra, probability/statistics, and multivariable calculus) this course is a great refresher to those topics and also makes you more aware of what kinds of things you may need to know if you're planning on taking upper level COS classes in machine learning. Definitely not too difficult and Ryan Adams and the course staff are so great!",,
good class but kinda hard online with recorded lectures,,
"Really liked this course! Had taken MAT 202, but didn't retain much from that course. Prof. Adams is a really good lecturer. Course load is very manageable, preceptors and TA's are really helpful, and I felt the psets reinforced a lot of the material covered in lecture and precept. Go to precept! They cover tips/example questions that are really helpful for the pset.",,
"I took EGR 154 and wanted a more solid foundation in linear before taking other ML classes ? would highly recommend to anyone in the same boat. The material was fairly straight forward, especially if you've already taken or are taking ORF 245/309. Ryan is a great lecturer, would recommend Geoffrey as a preceptor!",,
"Watch the videos, read the book, the psets are cool!",,
"Geoffrey is one the best TA's I've had at Princeton. Go to his precepts, go to his office hours. Reach out if you need help. This TA is amazing! The course is great for people that are familiar with coding, but also good for beginners, you just might need to spend more time on assignments.",,
"This class is okay; the first half is definitely doable even without MAT202, and I got a very good understanding of linear algebra with Prof. Adams's video lectures. That said, the quality of the course declines significantly after the midterm: probability/vector calculus is covered nowhere near as well (combined with the fact that there is a no collaboration policy, so your only option to get help is the scarce office hours). The weekly psets can definitely get to you, so make sure to give them a quick scan when they're handed out (they range from ""very easy"" to ""extreme suffering""). It's also worth noting that this class was one where none of the staff bothered even mentioning Dean Dolan's message on mental health, much less made any changes or any attempt at all to reach out to us students, so take that as you will.",,
"I loved this course. Prof Adams is really passionate about helping us learn, and his availability, responses to questions, and presenting of the subject material is unparalleled. Really great course to take if you want to build confidence with the math material you may have seen already, and see it applied towards genuinely useful applications.",,
"Wow so useful, definitely take if you have any interest in machine learning or data analysis and do not feel like you have a strong background in math. I took calculus in HS and took MAT 202 at the same time as this course, but other than that had no experience with math classes at Princeton. I was a chemistry major in my senior spring, so obviously I had done some math in my science classes and I took COS 126 the semester before, so I would definitely recommend having some minimal programming experience. The assignments were really interesting, sometimes even fun. Professor Ryan is good at explaining how to do the math, as well as how it is useful (no small feat).",,
"Good class! Take it with Prof. Adams. He's super helpful in office hours and just exceedingly understanding and helpful. He actually knows what the psets are asking for (which is NOT the case in all COS departmentals) and is really willing to help you with the psets or general course material. The psets are not bad at all, and the midterm was fair.",,
go to precept and review precept notes! you'll do just fine if you keep up with lectures and go over the homework.,,
"Dry material, made me question my interest in ML. Psets being no-collab was not kind.",,
"I would take this course if you would like to improve your knowledge of linear algebra, probability, and multivariate derivation, as well as to gain skills in coding in Python. Having taken previous courses on these topics would be immensely useful (MAT 202/EGR 154, ORF 245, MAT 201/EGR 156) as the course assumes general knowledge of 201/202 and has a large focus on the probability covered in ORF 245 (though this section of the course is taught without assuming much prior knowledge). I found the problem sets to be interesting at times, though they weight heavily in the course grade so it is important to stay on top of them and attend office hours as needed. I am anticipating that having taken this course I will be better prepared for COS 324 and other machine learning courses - I do feel like I improved my conceptual understanding of many of the topics covered in the course.",,
"I would highly recommend taking this course if it is at all relevant to topics/fields you are interested in. As someone outside of math (and who had not taken a derivative in... years), it was paced well and clearly. While I definitely struggled some weeks to grasp material, the pacing and ordering of material built nicely and I feel I have a much more intuitive understanding of methods than from past classes on the topic. Additionally, I felt that if I had more experience I would have still benefitted from the deeper dive. Prof Adams' lectures were clear, concise, and engaging--he clearly cares about teaching!",,
It is helpful to know everything here but the class won't make you that much more comfortable with the topics. It's chill though,,
"If you want a solid review of linear algebra and probability and also want an introduction to the type of math you will be doing in ML, this course is a must take. If Geoffrey is a preceptor again, try to get him - he is absolutely a beast at explaining topics more in depth! Course load is not too heavy if you have already seen some of the math that appears.",,
"Definitely! Take it if you want to gain a more solid mathematical foundation and understanding of linear algebra, probability, and optimization, topics needed for machine learning.",,
"This course was excellent. It was enjoyable and quite insightful. I really loved how Professor Adams often connected concepts to really fascinating ML applications, topics, and areas of study. I definitely feel much more ready and confident to take on COS 324 and other ML courses here at Princeton. I do wish that the lecture material contained more walkthroughs of example problems. If you have a strong linear algebra and probability/statistics foundation, you may not NEED to take the course, but if you feel like you could benefit from a more substantiated foundation in these areas prior to taking ML courses here, this course is a phenomenal option.",,
Very informative and helpful course to set up a good foundation. The weekly assignment set is somewhat time consuming but well worth it. Would recommend!,,
