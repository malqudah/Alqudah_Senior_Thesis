Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Professor Singer is nice. We had some complications due to classes moving online, but I did learn a good amount. The problem sets were kind of hard to manage online and due to lack of resources, which led to them being extended often. The assignments were pretty difficult for someone with no python experience, and often times there's very little introduction to some of the libraries used. Some of the TAs were not super helpful.",,
"I have nothing nice to say, so I won't say anything at all. Take only if you're trying to get the COS certificate and avoid 226 & 217",,
not as bad as in past years,,
"Contrary to what some may believe from past years, Prof. Singer did a fantastic job teaching the material both on campus and remotely. He was very accommodating with the assignments, and I felt like I learned quite a lot from doing them. Also, Daniel ""Changyan"" Wang is an incredible preceptor with one of the fastest response times to email/piazza I've ever seen. Not only that but he's incredibly fair with grading. If Singer teaches the course again, I highly recommend taking it (though take the online format into account for this review).",,
"The class was quite disorganized, most of the assignments requiring multiple downloads because of existing bugs given by the staff. The staff somewhat made up for it by giving many extensions for the assignments though. Overall did not think I learned much about machine learning; it was much more theoretical/mathematical and the assignments seemed more like debugging and making sure the matrix dimensions were correctly constructed rather than learning how to use machine learning to solve problems.",,
Not bad.,,
"Take the course. This year was a significant improvement over the previous iterations of the course with Professor Singer. Changyan Wang was the best preceptor. Have a look at the Programming Assignments when they come out. Some take longer than others. Even though you may be able to do these assignments without understanding 100% of the material, I highly recommend that you go to the lectures - it was worth it.",,
"I think this course needs some more work before it's worth taking. It had more of an applications focus this year, but there was a disconnect between the dense mathematical notation on the lectures slides and fill-in-the-blank style coding assignments, from which I didn't really learn much. Also, while I appreciate the course staff's flexibility in making things easier for us towards the end of the semester, it seemed like assignment specifications and grade policies were constantly changing. Had it not been for this amazing TA (Daniel) who was super responsive on Piazza, I feel like the course would have fallen apart. Not a terrible class but it needs more structure.",,
"Some materials are interesting, but the course is not well-structured. Firstly, we don't have a clear grading scheme of the course until almost the end of the semester. Secondly, the plans are always changed throughout the course. This may be because of the disruption, but it happens since the beginning of the course. Lecture is fine, but it doesn't cover the most important material that we should know in the machine learning. Finally, I think the assignments did not help students to understand the materials better. They were tedious and not structured. I would recommend taking with the other instructors instead.",,
Don't take if Singer is teaching it. Learn ML from online courses instead.,,
"Do not take, this was one of the worst classes I've taken at Princeton.",,
"Professor Singer is a very nice professor, and he really cares about the students. The assignments were pretty fun and educational, and all-in-all I feel I was able to come away understanding the basic underpinnings of machine learning. That being said, the course was much more theoretical than I expected. I did enjoy learning the mathematics behind machine learning, but I wish I could've learned more hands-on, applications-based skills.With regard to the lectures and curriculum, I was overall a bit disappointed. I felt that the new machine learning topics were not motivated well enough, and it wasn't always clear why method A is better than method B, or why method A is even necessary, or if there are pros and cons of each method, etc.By the end of the course, I felt that I had learned many of the fundamental underpinnings of machine learning (as well as Python + NumPy), but I still was hoping for a more cohesive, broad-picture understanding of machine learning, rather than simply having learned several techniques without much motivation and purpose.",,
"I thought it was a decent introduction to machine learning. The coding assignments were kind of strange in that we only had to fill in some of the code and so it was hard to understand the full picture. Singer was pretty invested in the lectures and the slides, but the topics were frequently confusing. He should have done more to motivate each of the topics before teaching them. Changyan was a god though, super helpful and clear and always on piazza.",,
"Hard to follow. Dives too deep too fast, especially for an introductory class. The lecturer is kind and understanding, however.",,
"It is astonishing how the department can't teach an introduction to ML course after years of trying -- this has been the case since this senior's freshman year. Assignments were extremely disorganized. There did not appear to be a plan for problem sets -- the course staff were laying out the track as the train rolled through. Course staff also changed how the class would be graded right before the last week of classes, and anyone who got <40% on a problem set would fail the entire class. tl;dr assignments and class organization were awful, lectures were okay.",,
"A bit disorganized, sometimes moves too slowly, but otherwise fine and will only get better as the dept creates proper teaching aids. Note it does not cover that much in ML",,
"Steer clear. I was wary of the poor reviews from the last time Singer taught this course but stuck with it because of how adamantly he said he was working to change the course to be more approachable. Semester started off okay - lectures were accessible and Prof seemed to be open to feedback on whether we were all understanding things alright. Trouble was 2nd half of the semester: grading expectations changed so many times that students couldn't even keep up with what the latest update was, virtual lectures and some office hours got canceled without explanation (students sat in empty Zoom calls for 1 hour+ before giving up), etc. I was very sympathetic to the difficulties of the switch to virtual instruction and was stressed but not mad about these issues at first. However, it became evident that the Prof had a poor attitude and little sympathy for the students' stress. When students (not myself) VERY politely asked for updates/transparency on Piazza, Singer passive-aggressively thanked the portion of students who were ""patient"". Obviously students would be asking for grading updates the evening before the PDF-election deadline, since we had been promised grade updates so we could make adequate decisions. We did receive updates just in time, but the poor attitude was unnecessary and the constant grading scheme changes made everything very stressful. Students were stepping on eggshells trying to ask for transparency on Piazza. Although the lecture slides were pretty and I did learn the material, it was not worth the frustrations and stresses from dealing with the messy course logistics. However-- shoutout to Changyan for being one of the best TAs I've had. He explained concepts really well, made students feel comfortable asking questions, and showed a lot of empathy. A beacon of light in an otherwise very frustrating course.",,
"***DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH YORAM SINGER.*** ...... COS 324 Spring 2020 with Yoram Singer has been the worst taught and most logistically disorganized class I have ever taken at Princeton. The only redeeming factor was TA Daniel Changyan Wang who was responsive to Piazza questions and emails. ???? [?LECTURES?] Lecture slides had many typos, and we were taught basics such as the Chain Rule from calculus that should have already been assumed as prior knowledge coming into the course. Many students who came in with a baseline understanding of machine learning didn't learn anything new. We spent the entire first half of the semester on linear regression, logistic regression, and linear classification. In the last week, we only made it to k-means clustering, the most basic topic in unsupervised learning. Barely anyone showed up to class due to the terrible quality of the lectures. After the move to online learning at the end of March, the professor misjudged the students? attitude and gave HTML animations rather than recorded lectures, and told students to figure them out. ???? [?ASSIGNMENTS?] Assignments 0, 1, 2 and 5 took at most 1 hour, so students were scammed into thinking this class was smooth sailing. However, Assignments 3 and 4 took upwards of 20 hours and were way too involved given the scope of the course so far. Assignments were routinely released late and had many substantial bugs. Most recently, the course staff used the term ?take-home exam? to assign two more assignments due after dean?s date, which is an unacceptable violation of university policy. But this was entirely due to their inability to stick to a schedule in the first half of the course. ???? [?COURSE STAFF and LOGISTICS?] TAs such as Edgar would no-show their own office hours. Logistical questions regarding grading policy and assignment due dates would go unanswered on Piazza for weeks. Yoram changed the grading policy of this class more than 5 times, and many promises were broken. First the class was graded out of 110%, with the lowest 10% (an optional midterm) being dropped. Then, the class was A/D/F (any passing grade would become an A), but a week later was changed to see your grade before the PDF deadline. Then, it was to see an estimate of your grade before the PDF deadline, but if you get below 40% on a single assignment you automatically get an F. In the end, grades ended up being curved down despite the pandemic (needed >91% to get an A-, cutoff for A never released). The midterm was misleadingly not optional despite the circumstances. Threatening students with an F undermined students? sanity. ????[?SUMMARY?] COS 324?s lack of transparency caused students much anxiety and stress. COS 324?s confusing assignments and condescending course staff (except for Changyan) robbed students of their spring semester. Ask yourself: do you want to have miserable panic attacks about this class while trying to attend to a billion other more important things in life? Do you want to do irritating assignments that are so full of bugs that TAs need to hold daily office hours for you to complete? Do you want to be gaslighted and routinely lied to about the necessary standards for passing the course by unaccommodating course staff, and then passive aggressively blamed for choices that the instructors made? If the answer to any of those questions is no, please save your mental health and ***DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH YORAM SINGER.*** @Prof. Singer, you can improve this class by announcing the grading policy proactively, clearly, transparently, having clear assignment deadlines, having the TAs stick to a set office hours schedule and show up, and staying true to your word when something is announced. And please be more open to constructive criticism instead of just getting defensive and blaming the students for your mistakes. Until you make those changes,  ... [more]",,
"As a graduating senior, I have had my fair share of poorly organized classes, but none as bad as this course. While it is understandable that remote learning may have impacted initial plans by the instructors, in my opinion it does not sufficiently excuse this disaster. The optimist in me would like to believe that the instructors had the best intentions by trying to vicariously cover all the material. However, they completely missed the tone among students who were diligently trying to overcome various personal challenges to just stay afloat in the course. For example, after assigning only two short projects in the first half of the course, the instructors gave four extremely buggy assignments in the latter half of remote learning that they themselves had to revise multiple times. These assignments were significantly longer than those from the first half, with some taking as long as 20 hours. Instructors were also generally unhelpful, even missing their own scheduled office hours and blaming it on students, and they often took months just to return grades and feedback. Quality of lectures also significantly deteriorated throughout the latter half of the semester. While the initial format of a weekly Monday prerecorded video lecture followed by a Wednesday Q/A session was very well-received among students, the professor decided to change it to just posting an HTML ?interactive? slide show for students to figure out themselves. After backlash from students, the professor began holding live Zoom lectures, but by the end of the semester, less than fifteen students would actually attend due to the poor quality of instruction. The professor did not even realize that he had been accidently referring to the course as ?COS 234? on his slides for almost the entire semester. Instructors also reversed course policies multiple times throughout the latter half and lost their credibility among students. For example, instructors initially informed the class that the course would be graded A/D/F as a result of remote learning. About a week later, the professor announced that the class would instead be graded optional P/D/F with the promise that students would be able see their final grades before deciding their grading option. Soon after that, the professor notified the course that the final exam had been changed to a take-home final assignment that was twice the length of a normal assignment and to be administered after Dean?s Date, the deadline to elect P/D/F grading. After ignoring frantic Piazza posts about this for a week, the professor revised the policy to drop the lowest assignment grade but requiring a score of > 40% on each assignment to pass the course. He also announced that he would no longer show students their course grades, stating that students should just calculate and estimate where they stand themselves from returned assignments, thus again contradicting his own earlier policies. During all this time, instructors systemically ignored Piazza posts with questions about course policies. In conclusion, I don?t think the instructors ever realized how deaf and insensitive they were during this stressful time for many students. On many occasions I considered emailing my Dean about blatant violations of university policies, but by the end of the semester I genuinely became afraid to ask course policy questions on Piazza in fear of retribution from instructors to my grade. The only light during this disaster was preceptor Daniel Changyan Wan, who tried his best by being helpful and communicative with students through additional office hours and diligent answering of Piazza posts.",,
"This material is so interesting, but unfortunately Professor Singer really struggled to teach it. He was consistently unprepared for lecture, usually changing the material on the slides 5 or 6 times EVERY lecture. The order of learning was good, but the delivery was very poor. So sad because the material itself is so interesting and has so much potential, but his organization of the class was extremely poor and haphazard.",,
"A good intro! If you've taken classes that already touched on some ML, like Computer Vision, NLP, or even ELE 464 this semester, you might find some parts a little slow. But it's still worth taking to really solidify that knowledge and gain more intuition.",,
"Definitely would recommend! Professor Singer is very kind and understanding. Note it is focused on theory and implementing algorithms from scratch more rather than applications as may be useful for for non-CS students wanting to apply ML to their science/social science independent work for example.Still, this class helped me understand the background behind ML methods I was using for my JP.",,
"I came into this class with expectations low (considering past reviews), but I was still hopeful that maybe the course staff could cobble together something decent. The course began as sort of a joke, since the assignments were super easy, lectures were simple and often ended early (Prof Singer spent like 20 minutes going over an animation of how dot product works and how to do chain rule). The midterm was only tangentially related to what we covered in class, it was super short and basically just math without really much to do with ML. On the bright side, course staff announced beforehand that the midterm would be extra credit, so no one really took it too seriously.After we moved to the online format, assignments suddenly became many times harder, and took many times longer, but on the whole they were decently interesting, albeit frustrating to debug. My biggest complaint is that the course staff changed the grading policy probably around 4-5 times over the second half of the semester. The biggest ones were going from A/D/F to PDF optional to a completely different grading scheme where every assignment would be 20% of the grade with one dropped (and if you got <40 points on any assignment you would automatically fail the class), then ON the afternoon of the PDF deadline date it was announced that the midterm would no longer be extra credit because apparently people's grades were too high. Out of a total 110 points, (6 assignments including the final with one dropped and 10 points from the midterm) you needed 100 or more to guarantee an A- or an A. ???? ???? ???? If people take the midterm with the expectation that it would be extra credit, then it is unfair to reverse the decision on the literal last day. If we had known that it wouldn't be extra credit, then we would have prepared more for it and the assignments.I appreciate that the course staff always tried to accommodate our needs and recognized the challenges of learning online, but I would have preferred some consistency.",,
"this is a surprisingly demanding course, both theoretically and on the programming/implementation side. Definitely brush up on your python skills.",,
"This course was pretty chill (definitely easier than it had been previous semesters) and Singer + the TAs were really nice and understanding (they gave us a lot of extensions, made the final easier bc of corona, etc). The biggest thing about it though was that it was pretty disorganized--they kept changing the grading policy and changing deadlines. Also, if you have to pick a preceptor try and get Changyan! He really felt like he knew the most and was always there to help.",,
"Prof. Singer makes it pretty easy to do well in this class, though it is disorganized. Changyan was an amazing TA",,
"This course does a good job at introducing students to machine learning. It is not the most challenging course, but it is definitely interesting. Would recommend.",,
Spring 2020 was awesome! The revamped course structure and instructors' approach definitely made me get to understand the intuition behind fundamentals in ML. Perfect intro class!,,
"Be aware that this course requires more mathematical proof experience then prerequisites indicate! I frequently had a hard time following the lectures, but I have also never gotten a better grade in a computer science course so make of that what you will (this might also be a unique circumstance due to the pandemic.) Although the class's structure frequently changed, Professor Singer and the TA's (especially Changyan) do genuinely want to help, and the TA's are quite responsive on piazza. All in all this class will give you some kind of overview of machine learning algorithms but not necessarily what you are looking for.",,
"The course is not as bad as some people might say. COVID definitely screwed some things up, but I wouldn't run away from this course even if there are some bad reviews. It seemed pretty accessible to me, someone who is not a COS major and does not have a lot of programming experience.",,
I certainly think this course is the best option for COS majors. The course is rough around the edges but every faculty member associated is extremely qualified. I think that students who take this course need to be much more responsible for their own learning to be able to get the most out of it.,,
Should be a great course under Adams,,
"Most of what was taught can be easily learned on your own. We covered the basics of ML and coded around 6 of the algorithms we learned about. Would recommend taking it if you don't have experience with ML and don't feel like spending a week learning this stuff on your own. As for workload, it's really light with a 5-10 hour assignment every week.",,
It is shocking intro to ML is this bad.,,
"While one could tell Prof. Singer tried to improve and revamp the course (which is appreciated), I think this course still needs to figure out how to make lectures more engaging. Assignments seemed fine (but were a lot of Numpy debugging).",,
Great course for machine learning.,,
