Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Study really really hard for the midterm. It's way harder than I expected it to be, and I did study really hard.",,
"Essential stuff for anyone interested in COS or programming, and for any technical interviews. Be prepared though, it's challenging and time-consuming, and there's a lot of very clever COS majors in the class that will make it hard to get a really good grade.",,
Definitely take this course. A natural extension of 126 and honestly not much harder. My friend and I both have said we spent more time coding in 126 than we did in 226 and both classes have a very similar vibe. I also took 217 concurrently so this may have skewed my perspective because the assignments in 217 are much more difficult and I highly recommend taking 226 before 217. I had Maia Ginsburg as a preceptor and I would try to avoid her. I found her precepts somewhat unorganized and when we went online for the second half of the semester I got more out of watching other preceptors.,,
Don't take this course if we are dealing with Zoom school. It is very challenging. They didn't do live lectures so you might as well just watch Sedgewick's videos on YouTube if you want to learn algorithms.,,
"If you are interested in COS, you should take this class! It's so interesting to see all of these algorithms and data structures and the clever ways people have attempted to solve a wide variety of problems. The lectures are great, and the assignments are interesting and compelling without becoming too overwhelming. If you're planning to major in COS you have to take it anyway, but at least with this class you can have fun while doing it. Keep up with the quizzes and try to stay ahead of assignments, and you will thank yourself later.",,
Take it if you want to learn computer science theory.,,
Definitely find a partner and start assignments at least two days before because in the beginning it might not take you more than a few hours but you will have to put more effort in later and if you ever miss something in lecture or precept or can't figure something out its likely that your partner will offer insight and explanations that can really help!,,
Attend all lectures and precepts. Start assignments early and ask preceptor questions.,,
"This was such a good course!! I HIGHLY recommend. You have to take it to be a COS major, but tons of ELE/physics/ORFE/other STEM majors take it too. The material is very useful and relevant, will definitely help in terms of having a solid foundation about how to solve computer science problems efficiently. Kevin Wayne is an amazing lecturer and he explains things super well. The class is extremely well organized.",,
"If you're a COS concentrator, then you'll have to take this course. Make sure you stay engaged with the material and give it your best effort - you'll really enjoy it if you do. If you're not a COS concentrator, I would recommend taking this course anyway. This content covered in 226 is useful in almost every other discipline, and even if it's not directly helpful to you, it strengthens your problem-solving and creative thinking skills. Not to mention - the faculty teaching this course are phenomenal and are extremely accomplished in the field of computer science.",,
Highly recommend this class. The course covers a lot of content frequently tested on SWE internships. Moreover the lectures are excelled.,,
"Take it! You will never cease to be amazed by the amount of genius in all the algorithms you learn throughout the course. The class isn't easy, but it's super rewarding.",,
"Stay engaged in lecture and precepts, and you'll have a lot of fun with this course!",,
"Difficult class for sure, but you learn a lot!",,
"This is a really great course to learn about some really fundamental Algorithms and Data Structures. As someone who is super new to all of this, it's super cool and the course is taught pretty well. I would recommend it.",,
"The organization and structure of this course is impeccable. The quizzes after each lecture are essential to understanding the material in the class and also to prepare for the exams, so make sure to do them diligently. The programming assignments are challenging but very interesting and fun to do. The readme is where a lot of students lose points, so make sure to give some time to it.",,
"Great course! Despite being a lot of work, it is very enjoyable.",,
If you want to take this course. Actually take your time to understand and explore it and don't just rush through it if you want to go into this feeling.,,
"If you are unsure to start in this course or 126, then you should try the first assignment out. If it seems doable after the guidance in precept, then I recommend staying in the course. The course is phenomenal, and having previously taken a data structures course at another institution gave me a good background to build substantially off of during 226. The depth of concepts in 226 kept me quite interested, and the class was quite enjoyable overall. Kevin Wayne is an awesome professor (he deserves all the recognition he gets), and Chris was an amazing preceptor (our precept would even stay after and have fun doing interview problems together!)",,
"1st, choose Professor Ibrahim as your preceptor if possible. The way he explained lessons and assignments previews was amazing and so beneficial, don't think it could've been better. 2nd, and just as a general note, don't start the assignments on Monday morning or Sunday night. I did this for the first half of the semester and my Mondays were terrible because of this. Towards the second half I started around Friday, and working piece by piece instead of writing the entire program at once was so much more enjoyable and beneficial.",,
"Always try to get Ibrahim as your preceptor, he's absolutely amazing.",,
"This is a must-take course for anyone interested in working in COS industry. I recommend taking it in freshmen spring, as it will enable you to be a much more successful applicant to internships between your sophomore and junior year.",,
Don't be shy to ask questions; the people overseeing this course is very helpful!!,,
"TAKE THIS CLASS. If you enjoyed 126, this is all that 126 offered and more. The lectures are engaging, assignments are fun, and precepts are exciting. Although it is harder than 126, there are so many resources to help whenever necessary.",,
"It's a challenging class but if you put in the time, go to precepts and start assignments early, it's manageable.",,
Pay attention to lecture.,,
"If you are a COS concentrator you need this course. But if you're just interested, I think it's a great extension of COS126. It goes into familiar territory like queues and stacks while building on how to use them in really clever algorithms. Assignments are similar to COS126 but harder and they don't hold your hand as much, but it is more rewarding when you are finished. You will learn a lot about different ways to sort, search, etc and it will show you there are always clever solutions to difficult problems.",,
"Great course! Very clear expectations and manageable workload, even as a non-COS major (MOL major here). Expect to put in 5-15 hours of work in per assignment, each assignment taking a bit longer than the last.",,
A must-take.,,
"Take this class! It teaches you what you need to know (and more) about algorithms and data structures in a manageable and presentable way. If you are interested in computer science past the introductory level, this is a great place to go (useful material for job interviews, etc.). Also, do not be intimidated as a COS concentrator. While the problem sets can be very time consuming, they are satisfying.",,
.,,
"Collaborate on assignments. Take advantage of your resources (TAs, office hours, textbook...). Give yourself plenty of time to study for exams (study gradually). Use past exams to study!!",,
"Okay so real talk ... this course is a rough ting fam. I'd say you have to be either really good at math or programming or both to be able to go through this course without straining yourself. Point is it's hard. But the great part is the course staff KNOW it's hard and they provide a myriad of resources to help you. The Ed forum is amazing, the preceptors are amazing, Kevin Wayne responds to anything in literally 24 hours or less. The textbook is also really good. If you missed anything in lecture, the lecture videos are really good. The quizzes on Quizzera may seem like a hassle, but they are incredible checks of understanding. These quizzes make it possible for you to understand the material on a weekly basis instead of having to scramble to cram for the midterm and the final. All in all, it's hard, but there is SO MUCH HELP. Be prepared for the time commitment, but be also prepared to leave your pride at the door and get all the help you need.",,
"This class is really cool, but takes a lot of time. If you liked COS 126, I found that this was a lot of the fun stuff of 126 (learning about cool algorithms and methods for solving problems). But, assignments do get longer, and while you have more tools for dealing with them, that was definitely an issue. Professor Wayne is an incredible lecturer - his classes were amazing!",,
"This class is run very well, definitely use office hours and lab TAs to get through the assignments, but you learn a lot.",,
Take the class (obviously). You'll survive and probably do well.,,
Seek help when you need it and manage your time accordingly,,
Take it! Interesting class that changes the way you think.,,
"It's a difficult course so I would not recommend it as an elective or 5th class. If you have to take it, know that the assignments take about twice as long as in COS126, but the staff is super helpful (shout out to Professor Wayne and Ibrahim!!). Attend lab TAs, office hours, and don't be afraid to even email professors for help outside of scheduled hours! Maybe compile your cheat sheets for exams as you go through the course topics so you won't have to do it all in the week before.",,
"Start the assignments early, always go to precept (especially for the assignment tips), actually engage with the content beyond just doing the bare minimum to pass the Quizzera quizzes. This is a very, very good course",,
"Try not to study everything at the end of the course. If you keep up with the work then you'll be fine. Also, use the resources if you need to, the preceptors are very open to helping.",,
"Take this class. It enriches your coding experience, you get to work on cool programs, and you come out feeling like you've learned a lot. Assignments are comparable in length (slightly longer) than 126 assignments and significantly easier than 217 assignments. Good class to take",,
Absolutely amazing course. Wayne is one of the best lecturers at Princeton and his slides are 11/10.,,
"Don't be afraid to go to ask for help when you need it! Lab TA and office hours are your friends for the assignments. Most assignments let you have a partner so if you think you'll need the boost from working with someone else, make sure you take this class with a friend! Course does a great job of connecting the practical applications of what you learn with the assignments!",,
I think this is known... but great class. Really helpful for someone looking to create a strong computer science base.,,
"Challenging but rewarding course, definitely my favorite this semester. If you liked COS126 you'll love this class: it has a healthy mix of theory and application and covers key topics for tech interviews. This class has a high effort to reward ratio in that if you dedicate the time and stay engaged, you will do well. The first half of the semester can be heavy: each week has 4 hours of lectures/precepts, quizzes, and a programming assignment. The second half is lighter since the programming assignments become less frequent. Do the extra credit + leaderboard as they could bump your grade. The textbook technically isn't required, but it has good explanations so I'd recommend checking it out. Look at past exams: they are very different from the assignments and you will need to study for them. Set a weekly reminder on your phone to complete the quizzes. Precepts: if you prefer a preceptor who goes over the material slowly, consider getting Prof. Ginsburg (also one of the nicest people you'll ever meet). I personally found her precepts a bit too slow (and we usually didn't finish the handouts), so if you learn quickly you might prefer a different preceptor. On the whole, Prof. Wayne and the course staff are very approachable and will make this course an enjoyable one!",,
"It's a big time commitment, but you will learn a lot!",,
This course is structured really well and I highly recommend!,,
Really interesting course! Prof. Wayne is a really great lecturer.,,
Work hard,,
"This class is difficult and time consuming, and I don't think anybody will disagree with that. Be prepared to spend a sizable chunk, if not most, of your weekends on the assignments. Tests require a TON of studying, as they are very hard. That said, it is an excellently structured and taught course. Ibrahim is an amazing preceptor. If you like computer science, algorithms, etc. take this class. It is very information-based, as in you are learning concepts and ""facts"" about algorithms and data structures. Basically, take the class if you like cos.",,
"Personally, I would not be surprised if school makes taking this class mandatory for every student. It is that good and worth your time. You will learn a lot, and it will change your way of problem solving.",,
"Be prepared to spend a lot of time debugging, but assignments in general are pretty manageable (coming from someone whose only intro to coding before this was COS 126). Exams do require a lot of practice/studying, so be sure to keep that in mind/plan for it",,
"It is challenging compared to COS126. But, if you can put in work and effort into it, you can definitely succeed. Also, live lectures with Kevin Wayne are wonderful. They are very helpful so please go!",,
Do NOT start the assignments the day it is due.,,
Kevin Wayne = god. Great course. Super well organized. Learned a lot. 10/10,,
"As a non-COS major, this is honestly one of the most useful classes I've taken at Princeton. Lectures are very informative and the assignments let you work on some interesting applications. The exams can be pretty challenging.",,
Review lecture slides. Ask questions early.,,
"It's a great course, even if the breadth of topics explored may seem intimidating. Professor Wayne is an amazing lecturer and Maia Ginsburg is a very patient instructor. Just put a recurring reminder for the weekly quizzes so you don't miss them, and make sure you start fairly early on the assignments (they are not terrifyingly hard but it's easy to make mistakes or get stuck). It's an easy class if you keep up with the material!",,
great course! start of assignments early,,
Take it.,,
"kevin wayne is great. great assignments, good course!",,
"Chris Sciavolino is an awesome preceptor, super helpful, super energetic, and carried us through the Covid times. The lectures with Prof. Wayne (while they lasted) were great too, with tech interview questions and lots of interaction. Took this course right after COS126 and it's fitting because the assignments are also in Java. Genuinely a great course for studying algorithms, should you need them or are interested in them.",,
Reading the textbook is by far the best way to complete your understanding of concepts in lecture and be prepared for tests.,,
"Great Course! Wayne is a great prof. I mean they use the same tactics as in 126 so you won't really be surprised. But for the love of all things holy, spend time on the read me's.",,
"This is a challenging course, but I found it to be enriching! I took it as a requirement for the COS major, and I had heard that it was extremely difficult, but if you do well on the assignments and quizzes, that is a significant part of your grade. I really liked the assignments; they were challenging at times, but it felt really good to get them figured out. There are great resources for help, like Lab TAs and office hours, that I used much more in 226 than I did in 126. Be prepared to not understand every single thing at a particular moment, but you can ask for help from these resources and work through the assignments for the most part in order to figure it out. I did well on the assignments and quizzes, but not well on the exams. I think it is fairly difficult to do as well on the exams as on other parts of your grade, so don't be discouraged. I loved lectures with Professor Wayne and precept with Ibrahim. I also highly recommend partnering for your assignments!",,
"TAKE THIS COURSE!! Kevin Wayne is an AWESOME professor and you do not want to miss this opportunity. You will cover so many interesting topics, and I don't doubt this will be one of my favorite classes from Princeton. If you liked 126, you will LOVE 226.",,
"TAKE THIS COURSE! One of, if not my favorite course I've taken at Princeton. Wayne is a great lecturer, the material is fascinating and organized, and the assignments are well designed. Start the assignments early and don't forget to do the weekly quizzes.",,
Solid course on algorithms. The workload is medium. The grading is kinda harsh.,,
"Doing well on the programming assignments is important, but do not neglect the theoretical side. Prepare rigorously in advance for the exams.",,
"To do well on the exams, study old exams religiously. To do well on assignments, start them early and ask for help.",,
"Utilize all resources available, such as precepts and office hours, to better understand the material.",,
A great second COS course. Works great alongside COS217,,
A must take course for any STEM interested people!,,
"Like 217, this course benefits from years of accumulated instructor experience and what I imagine is careful tinkering with curriculum. It delivers an extremely high-quality experience in lecture and on assignments. Remember that extra resources are available for the assignments, including pre-recorded videos which can be really helpful. Bob Sedgewick's recorded lectures are all on YouTube and are great as well. Transitioning to remote during the coronavirus crisis was smooth for this course thanks to dedicated work by the lecturers and preceptors.",,
"Kevin Wayne is a fantastic lecturer. The assignments are all quite interesting and cool applications of what we learned in class. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course!",,
Stay on track with the lectures and actually remember how to do those quizzeria quizzes.,,
Great class! Make sure you give yourself some time for the assignments.,,
Take it if you liked 126 and have further interest in programmming/cs,,
Good course.,,
"if you understand everything on the practice exams, you'll do fine on the actual exams",,
"Take it! One of the best and career-relevant COS classes you'll ever take! However, be prepared to challenge yourself and work hard because the assignments and exams are both time-consuming and require clear understanding.",,
Make sure you have the time to really commit to learning the material.,,
Awesome class! Keep up with lectures and be prepared to learn a great deal!,,
Go to Lisa Jian's precept. By far the best preceptor.,,
Keep up with the lecture notes and complete the problems in the study guide to ensure you are understanding the material on a level ready for the exam.,,
"Take this course in a 4 to 5-course schedule only. Definitely take it if you have any interest, as it is incredibly educational and applicable to other courses and interviews.",,
Such a good course. Kevin is an amazing lecturer. Recommend taking if you have any interest in expanding your coding knowledge.,,
"Lab TAs can be very helpful w debugging, especially if you go to them with issues Saturday night or before then (which means starting assignments Friday ish, but it's worth it!). Now a prospective COS major!",,
