COS 324 is best described as a "rollercoaster". Its difficulty wildly varies from semester to semester, with the exams this spring being disproportionately difficult when compared to the fall. On behalf of many students in this course, I can say that we were incredibly misled on the difficulty of the midterm. This is largely due to the fact that we all took the midterm from the previous semester, did very well, and then were notified at 10:22PM the night prior to the exam that "This midterm is expected to be substantially more difficult than the practice midterm from last semester". That's quite literally ONLY 14 HOURS before the exam, which is just absurd that this was not mentioned sooner. There was NO prep material provided that would represent the level of difficulty of these exams. This inadequate support for studying, piled on top of unengaging homework, confusing lectures, and insufficient math review unfortunately forces me to not recommend this course.</div>

They cover a lot of topics, explain them pretty well, and show applications to make things fun and interesting. Daddy Deng was an absolute beast and explained the concepts well and Olga was very energetic and fun. Some things were a bit hard to follow, but it all made sense with time and the precepts. Not much work too - only a few hours of homework a week. </div>

Make sure that you have a good basis of linear algebra before taking. The exams are rough. They nailed me in da booteehole. Overall, learned some things, a lot of theory and the worse parts of linear algebra, cried. Not the worse, but the exams be examing too much. 6/10</div>

This course really demystified all the buzzwords commonly associated with machine learning and gave a solid intro to all the main topics. I feel like I learned enough, and I know what I am interested in pursuing further and what I am not interested in. However, it felt like a survey course. We never went in-depth, and the problem sets/programming assignments were insanely easy. I barely had to think about the material in order to do the work for this class. And yet, the midterm was WAY harder than anything we had done - I would dare to say that the class genuinely did not provide the resources necessary to do well on this exam. The final was fair, though. Overall, employers want to see classes like this on your resume, and it is accessible to anybody who satisfies the prerequisites. I will be working with computer vision in my internship this summer because of this class. But just because I would recommend it does not mean it cannot be improved.</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Honestly this course added a lot of stress to my life in the two days before the problem sets / programming assignments were due. Not an easy course, but fortunately this isn't the type of class where you're totally doomed if you don't go to office hours either. In terms of weekly time consumption, this course isn't too bad, but don't expect it to feel easy. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This class needs to be seriously re-thought. It is intro to machine learning! it should be so interesting and well-taught for how important it is! However, it was the worst cos class I've taken so far--I honestly do not know what I learned. The level of the homework/programming assignments did not remotely match the midterm and no prep/practice tests of the same level were given. One particular moment that just exemplifies the bad teaching/organization/lack of concern for students: at 11pm the night before the midterm the professors emailed the entire class saying that the midterm would be much harder than any practice. Obviously, this just caused everyone to panic when there was nothing more we could do to prepare. The lectures are not good (20 ish students attending by the end) so you would do better just reading the slides/course notes on your own. I really hope the department improves this class because it was such a disappointment.</div>

There are a lot of assignments with the HWs and the Programing assigments, so just do them in a group with some friends. Precepts go into a little bit more depth with writing actual code, lectures is all conceptual/abstract. You'll probably spend a non-trivial amount of time debugging the programming assignments. Overall, would still recommend (i think its basically required for COS '25 anyway)</div>

The topics were interesting, and the lecturers were great. The midterm was very hard compared to last year's, but the final was easier compared to last year's. Avoid Mr. su as your preceptor. I could have not gone to precept all semester and did just as well.</div>

It turns out this is another theory based course where the teachers don't really have an idea of what they are doing because it is a new course and changes every semester. It seems like it's a gamble of whether this course is good or not dependent on the semester.</div>

I actually enjoyed going to precept because of his great sense of humor and friendly demeanor. Find people to do psets and assignments with because having others to bounce ideas off of.</div>

Before this course, I thought of "machine learning" as a nebulous term, but I found the content of this course to be very enjoyable with many real-life applications, and it's nice to know what exactly ML is now! I think a background in linear algebra would be very helpful for this course, but you could probably still do well without it. I also found the assignments to be manageable, even though I'd only had java coding experience previously. If you're interested in machine learning, I would definitely recommend this class!</div>

The final was a lot more fair. Precepts could be more engaging/clear in what parts of class (assignments etc) they are relevant to. Sometimes assignment wordings were unclear/wrong. Overall a somewhat frustrating class, especially for such a key subject in computer science, but hopefully they can make it better.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Good overview of some machine learning topics, definitely an intro course. Not too much work if you are already familiar with Python/numpy. Exams were a bit difficult but the course is curved. Lecture quality varies based on professor. TAs sometimes did not show up to office hours, but hopefully that isn't an issue going forward. Course staff were not very responsive on Ed, so learn from other students. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This class was okay. I felt that it could have been better organized; for instance, the first week they gave us two assignments due on Wednesday but didn't start office hours until the Tuesday before it was due. Additionally, because the instructors constantly change, it felt like no one really had a certain answer to course policy questions. Overall, I think the course material is difficult, so the exams were rough, but after the first weeks, the assignments are doable. It wasn't the worst class but it doesn't make me want to continue taking ML courses.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I really liked this course. I came into it knowing absolutely nothing about machine learning, but 324 tries its best to introduce different kinds of learning (supervised, unsupervised, deep, reinforcement). Highly recommend it, even if the midterm destroyed me</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is probably the best and most accessible class to learn machine learning at Princeton, and possibly the world. This is because it emphasizes a connection between the math and the programming which is done in a relevant way. Some people might complain that the math is too hard, but this is because they start at the level that they continue for the whole course. It really doesn't get any harder than the stuff they show in the first week. Additionally even that isn't very hard if you feel comfortable with your basic multivariable calculus and linear algebra. If you are feeling behind spending 5 days before the semester to look at some online resources and do some practice problems will get you at the perfect level for this class. All in all you should take it!</div>

Midterm was awful, we were given one practice midterm and the instructors told us at 10PM the night before the midterm that the actual one would be much harder than the practice...the average score was a D-. Lots of assignments going on, there are both programming assignments and PSETs so it's a lot of work. Curving is not clear so it's hard to know where you stand grade-wise.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This course is a solid introduction to machine learning. Lectures cover many cool ML topics, though not in too much depth (some topics may only be covered in a lecture or two). Assignments alternate between programming and written homework, and the workload is much more manageable than 226 or 217. Coding is only a small portion of this course, as most of it focuses on ML theory. If you don't have linear algebra experience (at the level of MAT202), the mathematics of the course may be a bit difficult. Both the midterm and final exams are fair. Overall, a great course!</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">It is okay. I am a little bit disappointed. No real math to do. Programming assignments rarely require more than 40 lines of code. It is a good overview and I'll def explore the topic more but don't expect too much. Lectures are meh. Prof. Russakovsky is amazing tho. Prof. Deng is not great. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This was a fine intro to machine learning. I learned multiple really cool ML things, the programming assignments (6 of them) were very fun, but everything else (including the 4 or 5 written homeworks) was not as fun. I'd recommend the course, but I also didn't adore it. It was pretty good, I guess.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">The class isn't a lot of work if you have a solid grasp of linear algebra and have had some experience with machine learning and linear regression in the past. The assignments aren't a lot of work compared to other COS classes.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a very solid introduction to machine learning, but is not as mathematical as I would have liked. The lack of clarity in instructions on the programming assignments is very frustrating at times, so I recommend starting them early and going to office hours as much as possible.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">The material was interesting, but the course was okay. HWs and PAs were fair but midterm was brutal. Theory heavy, which leaved more to be desired from PAs, but still take the course because its ML</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Good intro survey to fundamentals of ML and more specific applications like , elementary language models, NNs and RL. Organization of this class was not great but the lectures are presented at a level where enough math is discussed for comprehension but it is still very accesible.</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Only take this class if you are a COS major interested in taking more ML classes (CV, NLP, etc). It's being rewritten so the class is more organized and better taught than what I've heard from previous semesters. But, it's consistent work as there are weekly alternating psets and programming assignments. You also need to save a lot of time to study for the midterm and the final.</div>

The programming assignments are fine but teach you nothing, but the big problem is just that the expectations in this class for how well you need to learn which material are thoroughly unclear. This class, because it surveys a lot of topics in ML, dips its toes into a lot of them, but I think the class dips its toes to a really weird point in each topic, where we neither go in depth to be completely intuitively convinced and understand a topic well, but we are expected to have some sort of quasi-mastery. Hopefully in the future instructors will provide more practice problems, but without practice problems, it was really hard to know what was expected of us. Take it if you must I suppose cause ML is good to learn, but it was not a fun experience for me.</div>

If you feel strongly about going into machine learning in the future, definitely take this course to see if your opinion changes. There are definitely fun and interesting aspects of the subject matter, but the presentation of it felt dry. Not a course for everyone, myself included, but I feel it encapsulates a lot of the introductory parts to machine learning you'd need to know in other courses.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Don't take it if you don't have to. The midterm basically killed everybody, the average was an F. The final could've been worse honestly. Homeworks and programming assignments were fine, just go to office hours if you get stuck. Programming assignments are in python. Expect to take several days working on the programming assignments if you're not familiar with matrix manipulation and vectors in python. I recommend doing the math with examples on scratch paper before coding it up. Major shoutout to TAs Ilya and Kathryn for their Ed help and helpful office hours. Without them, good luck getting a timely answer on your Ed questions with equally confused students because there's a policy that TAs should refrain from answering questions to let other students answer them first. The number of times you answer Ed questions also counts towards your grade. The midterm should've reflected what we did on homeworks and programming assignments more. The "practice" midterm and final were from last semester. I say "practice" because the midterm from last semester was too easy and literally the night before, Professor Deng said on Ed that our midterm would be significantly harder. I wish there were more problems we could've practiced on to better prepare for the midterm/final. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Definitely take if it's run the same way as it was in Spring 2022. I never thought I would have praise for a problem set but I genuinely had fun doing the programming assignments, and they were not overly time-intensive. I hope they keep the same lecture slides and programming assignments. Definitely take it for an introduction to machine learning.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">The average for midterm was 60%, can't wait for the final! Also no practice exams for midterm and final since the class has changed a lot, which makes it even harder to feel prepared. The assignments are manageable, but they are weekly.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Unfortunately for the Princeton COS department, which one would expect to have one of the best introductory courses to Machine Learning, has had another failure of a semester. A class that was marketed as "a non-mathy introduction to machine learning" was one that consisted, in entirety, of poorly taught mathematics, insufficient exam preparatory tools, and lectures/homeworks that are disconnected and not engaging. It would be more useful for a student excited about ML topics to complete a 3-week online Coursera course than to take this class. I hope, probably in vain like many before me, that the department reconsiders how this course is taught. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Not a great class. Homeworks and programming assignments were doable, however, the midterm was extremely unpleasant. As I write this, I can only hope that the final will be better, but it's not looking too good. Furthermore, lecture slides were extremely chaotic/overfilled. The course notes had many typos.At least this class made me realize early on that I do not like machine learning and will not be pursuing a career in that field. So I guess it was useful for something.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Great introduction to machine learning. The problem sets and exams seemed a bit disconnected from the lecture material, so definitely go to office hours for the written problem sets. Each assignment took between 5-12 hours. Exams were hard and a definitive step up from assignments in terms of difficulty... it's fine if exams are hard, but I think problem lied in the fact there weren't sufficient resources or preparation baked in the course for a student to do reasonably well on an exam. Because of students' performance in past semesters, it did feel like the course staff was working against us, and intentionally wanted to ensure a small percentage of the class did well. Strong math skills are a definite must; linear algebra is mission critical. Overall, I really enjoyed the class but think the course design needs to rethink what the goals of the course are (to provide a conceptual introduction to ML vs. to provide a conceptual and intensive mathematical baseline for ML) and restructure the course around that goal. The way it's currently formulated, it felt like the course was stuck somewhere in the middle, so students were always trying to hit a "moving target". </div>
