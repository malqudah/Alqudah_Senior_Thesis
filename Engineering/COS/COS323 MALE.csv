Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Great ORF departmental. AAA is a great lecturer. The grading system isn't great though, the midterm completely affected my experience with this class.",,
"Like many of Princeton classes that involves math, you won't be taught very well and techniques for solving math problems. Get a group of friends to collaborate on psets and study key concepts for the exams. You will be fine then. Lectures don't really help with the homework nor exams. If you are good at math and can solve problems, then you can get an A in the class without going to the lectures.",,
"Was an good course, lectures were decent and assignments were reasonable (though matlab can be extremely frustrating), if you think this is the best ORFE class ever per previous reviews though, be warned that it may not be all that it's hyped up to",,
"This class involved more proofs than I expected. Course material is pretty interesting but personally hard to follow for the whole semester, so I feel like if I wanted to understand the material I would probably need to take another convex optimization course",,
Work on your proofs.,,
"Take this course, but watch out for the exams!",,
"One of my favorite courses at Princeton. AAA and Cemil were both great. AAA is going on sabbatical so Cemil will teach it spring 2022. I have faith in him, as he lectured a few times and clearly knows what he's talking about. I really engaged with this class, I would put this class and orf 309 on similar levels. My biggest recommendation is to go to office hours, and to engage DURING lecture.",,
"This course is overhyped. If you are looking for an introduction to optimization, there are probably better options out there.",,
This course is really hard. Take on an easier semester if you have to. The problem sets take forever to do even if you go to office hours,,
"Take if interested in convex optimization. Difficult, but AAA is such a gifted lecturer.",,
Topic is kind of dry but AAA was pretty engaging. Would not recommend unless you really enjoy proofs.,,
"I came in with high hopes for this course, but was honestly super disappointed by it.  AAA is a great professor - he really cares and wants you to succeed (note: I think AAA isn't teaching it anymore after this semester).  However, the class itself was pretty rough.  8 problem sets with significant work posed a pretty tough time constraint.  The midterm was brutally hard - even when the practice midterms were completely fair.  The content itself is pretty theory-heavy, when I was hoping it would be more real-world/example-based.  I don't feel like I got much out of this class, unfortunately.  I really wanted this class to be amazing, but I would not recommend it to anyone.",,
"If you were traumatized by ORF 309 and decided to not take any more ORF classes, don't! Take this course! Lectures were of very high quality, the prof has great intuition about what things to explain and what things can be quickly skimmed over, when students are having trouble understanding, etc. The material is quite math-heavy, but the psets are very reasonable.",,
"This is by no means an easy class, despite the high ratings. AAA is one of the best lecturers in the ORFE Department and made tough (and often uninteresting) content much more manageable, but be prepared to spend a lot of time working on PSETs every week. Overall, great class to build some fundamentals in writing proofs and really learn but not the easiest way to finish the major.",,
Find a group to do PSETs with and go to AAAs and Cemils office hours!,,
Take this if you want a somewhat more challenging math elective that's more interesting. The course is very well organized and Cemil will do a great job teaching it next year.,,
"Note: AAA (Prof Amirali Ahmadi) is no longer teaching, but many peers and I trust that Cemil (who?s taking over) will do a great job teaching from here on out, based on his performance guest teaching a few lectures this semester. AAA is one of the most knowledgeable, well-spoken, and caring professors, definitely top notch in the ORFE department. This is the flagship ORFE course, primarily because of AAA?s teaching, in my opinion. The material, convex optimization, is arguably useful. Even if many real-life optimization application are not convex, this course still provides tools that form a solid foundation for optimization and proxies for more generalized problems. This year?s midterm was poorly designed, but we stay hopeful for future semesters. Assignments are difficult but doable with office hours.",,
"This course is a solid ORFE departmental, and it should replace ORF307 for sure.  While reviews in the past peg this to be THE ORFE course, I think that generally reflects poorer on the other courses in the department than it reflects something excellent about this course.  That said, I genuinely enjoyed the first 7 of 8 psets (2 psets dropped), applying optimization to domains including determining the optimal radiation beam dosage in chemotherapy, modeling sudoku as an optimization problem, and devising a method to capture student engagement in a course via decision variables.  This course really helps you to think about how to frame real world problems through convex optimization problems.  Other reviews will probably deride the difficulty of midterm and/or final, but as someone who had a middling performance on both, I genuinely left the course knowing more than when I came in, and that is the purpose of an education after all, right? Expect to spend between 6-10 hours per pset-- some of them are certainly tricky!",,
"Lectures were very well done; among some of the most clear that I've had here. However, I found the material to be rather bland for probably 3/4 of the semester. The first half comprises building on results you've probably seen in MAT201/202. The second half gets into descent algorithms, linear programming, semidefinite programming, and some computational complexity (which does finally get interesting in the end, imo). AAA is definitely wonderful though, and if the material appears more interesting to you, or if you can use the class for a departmental or SML or something, I'd say go for it. However, I think he won't be back in Princeton for a while after this semester. Cemil subbed in for a few lectures and I thought he was quite good and clear as well.",,
"One of the best ORFE departmentals I've taken. Definitely a little overrated (it's well-taught and the material is interesting but occasionally dry), but overall it's a solid class that builds up all theorems/applications from foundations (multivariable calc, linear algebra), something that can't be said of most ORF/engineering courses. The homeworks involve a lot of MATLAB coding and can be a time sink.",,
"[ORF Senrior] This is how you learn about optimization.  I think that this should replace 307 as a core class, and should be taken early in your 4 years to set yourself up for other ORF classes.  I took ORF311 before this class and I really regret that, I should have flipped them.  This gives you incredible fundamentals and skills at all kinds of optimization.  Expect difficult problem sets but help is provided and they are worth it.",,
Go to lecture and stay on top of problem sets.,,
"The class is extremely hard and has a large workload, which helps learn the concepts but makes it hard if you have other hard classes as well. take this class with other easy classes",,
AAA is an amazing teacher and presents the content well. Take it if he is teaching.,,
"Great course, lots of linear algebra. MATLAB is somewhat annoying but manageable. Unfortunately AAA is leaving :(",,
"Take it if you are an ORF major or very interested in math. You will need to learn MATLAB, so be prepared. AAA will help you understand the material and the teaching staff is very helpful, but the content is somewhat boring.",,
