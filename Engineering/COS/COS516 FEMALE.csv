Aarti is a great professor and the class is super interesting and relevant to all sub-domains of CS. The assignments and exam are very reasonable and back up the content well. The project is open-ended giving you the chance to explore your own interests.,,
"It can be very inspiring to think of the intersection of this subject and your own research area, and the lecturer will be very open and helpful.",,
I would highly recommend anyone interested in automated reasoning to take this course. Prof. Aarti Gupta is a dedicated teacher and really cares for her students learning. The assignments are interesting and fair. The project is also a great opportunity to explore any specific topic interest.,,
