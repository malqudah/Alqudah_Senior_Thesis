Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This class is not hard (assignments that aren't so difficult, and pretty short problem sets), and is really just a survey course on systems. I strongly recommend instead taking COS432 and COS418, which will help you get most of the material.",,
"The onboarding to learning golang was quite unsupported, and office hours were really crowded. The actual algorithms are not much harder than those in 226, but it was difficult to understand how to implement those in golang. Extremely generous grading policy (7 late days!) and infinite grading checks.",,
"Professors are very accommodating and lectures are interesting. Assignments are very straightforward. Probably not worth taking if you've already taken higher-level systems courses (e.g., COS318, COS418) as much of the content is review.",,
Really recommend as a COS departmental on the systems track. Work was not too bad and you know what you'll get on the assignments because of the grader bot. Pretty high level overview of systems,,
"This class is alright. It is hard and very time consuming, but it is manageable. PSETs are extremely annoying since you have to literally get quotes from lectures to answer them. Lectures have nothing to do with programming assignments, so you don't really need them in that regard. Programming assignments do take a long time, and there is little to no guidance on them. Oh and, Ed support is straight awful. Did not expect a 300 level course staff to take so long and blatantly ignore some posts lol. Regardless, the professors were extremely lenient this semester and I appreciate their willingness to help the students when times were rough and we made clear that something was just way too hard. I'd say if you need a systems class, this could be one, but just be prepared and make sure you aren't taking too many other classes that are coding intensive because this one eats a lot of time.",,
Easy course as a senior spring departmental. TBH thought it was easier than 217. Assignments and final project are fairly easy. Psets kinda suck because they are just lecture gotchas. Would not reccomend this to anyone actually interested in systems. Take something more engaging. Great course if you have to fill as systems req and you dont want to take a different systems req. Definetly a good course for those newer to cos.,,
"Not an amazing class. Problem sets were on Gradescope and were filled with ambiguous questions that didn't really make you think at all. Assignments were okay, but also required endless StackOverflow searches and trial and error to figure out how obscure features of Go worked. Lectures didn't really explore any topic in depth. Overall, a very meh class.",,
"This course is great for computer science students who want an overview of computer systems. Professor Rexford and Professor Levy are very experienced in the field and amazing people to talk to, and all of the preceptors are very nice and happy to help students.",,
"easiest systems, but interesting content! start on the final project earlier though",,
"While the quality of the class in terms of learning the material isn't great-- like I def can't apply what I learned to the real world and don't really know that much Go, it wasn't too hard to figure out how to do well in the class.",,
"If you're interested in systems, but want a taste of what's available, this course is like a survey of COS318, COS418, and COS463. I think you'll enjoy this class if you're interested in exploring systems topics. If you're not interested in systems, this is probably still a good fit, since it's not too in depth in any one particular region and will be easier than other systems alternatives. Do be aware that the assignment specifications are vague and occasionally wrong; hopefully this gets fixed before next semester. That being said, I think it was really good. Jen Rexford is a really good lecturer, and Amit Levy is also good. Overall, I would recommend this course unless you were sure you wanted to take OS and Distributed or something. Also, the course staff were only marginally responsive on Ed, and there weren't enough office hours.",,
"Took this course for the systems requirement! I liked it in a lot of ways: content was relatively interesting, the grading is pretty easy since assignments are graded on if it passes the tests, and the course staff was very generous with extending deadlines when students were struggling.Several cons for the course as well, though. Lectures are pretty much useless for completing the assignments, which I wish was not the case because the professors are pretty good lecturers and the material is actually interesting--just no incentive to attend. Specs for the assignments are SO vague, it could take a few hours just for my partner and I to read through the documentation and requirements and figure out where to start. You also have no clue how long the assignments will take because it varies so much (I recall 1 and 3 were super short, 2 and 4 were kinda painful). Precepts and office hours are very helpful!!Overall, not a painful class. Just do the assignments and try to learn something!",,
A good systems class. Prof Rexford is an excellent lecturer. Start coding assignments early and go to office hours for the psets.,,
Easy A. Take it if you just want the systems credit. It's also pretty much a survey course so don't expect to learn too much about any 1 thing.,,
"MUST TAKE FOR COS STUDENTS. The course was incredible. Conceptually, Professors Rexford and Levy taught complicated and nuanced topics in an articulate, organized, and clear way, such that I'm leaving the course with a strong understanding of what systems actually are. Assignments were challenging but fair, I spent about 10-15 hours on each assignment, with the notable exception of assignment 2 which was up to 30 hours. Make sure you get a good partner, otherwise you'll end up doing most of the assignments by yourself. Your assignments are ""automatically"" graded when you submit to GitHub, so you get immediate feedback about your program and know ""when to stop"". Problem sets were really manageable (3-5 hours each) and really reinforced concepts taught in the course. There was no midterm or final, but, because the course was taught so well and because there wasn't the pressure of having to perform on an exam, I actually learned so much about systems in a way that felt realistic under-real world circumstances. For example, for assignments, you're allowed to look up information online (StackOverflow, Google, etc), which granted me strong technical research skills and aligned with my real-world software engineering experience. This course should honestly be a blueprint for all COS departmentals, and cannot speak highly enough of my experience.",,
"The course staff had a difficult time with running this course. Assignment specs were vague at times and responses to questions were delayed. Thankfully, they did extend deadlines and remove some assignments to ease some of the pain. Manageable workload for a 300 level COS course. This class just needs better administration.",,
I would take this course because it really helps introduce many topics about networks and is useful in other classes like information security.,,
be prepared for this to be rough. def don't take unless there is nothing else you would want to take to fulfill the systems requirement,,
A nice course overall. I struggled a lot in COS217 but this wasn't that bad. Make sure you have a good partner and start on assignments early (some of them are a pain to debug). I like Go and would recommend taking this course.,,
Nice and easy overview of systems. Not a lot of work throughout the semester.,,
good,,
"Take this class for a great system distributional. I think that the final project was a little hard because of its open-endedness of it but also we just tried our best and submitted what we had. The instructors and preceptors are really nice, assignments are straightforward, and p-sets are too if you go to a lecture and look back at lecture slides and zoom recordings of the lectures.",,
"This course is fine. Take it if you need a systems distribution requirement. The assignments can be a bit obtuse, so definitely start early. I liked the autograder, but in practice it can be a bit finicky. You always know where you stand in this course because of the autograder, so that's a plus.",,
Familiarize yourself with the Go programming language before taking this course.,,
"This course is fire, definitely the Systems to take. You can do the programming assignments and the psets (mostly) without going to lecture, but I (mostly) still did because they were so interesting. This was the perfect class for me as a second-semester COS senior, but it might be harder for someone with less coding experience. Grading policy for the PAs is cool, autograded, unlimited submissions, and optimally-allocated late days. Plus you get a fat dopamine hit every time the autograder reviews your code.",,
"I highly recommend this course! Make sure to speak with professors or preceptors early to get help with difficult topics or assignments. I recommend trying to look for outside resources if extra help is needed, and doing other readings on the Go language to help with learning the language. The staff are very helpful, just make sure to ask for help!",,
"Great systems overview course! Workload is not too heavy, lectures are interesting and well taught, and assignments are very fair.",,
"easy systems course, would definitely recommend",,
This is a pretty nice and chill systems class. You get a nice overview of a bunch of systems topics and the professors did a great job of presenting concepts in a way that was easy to understand. There are no exams which makes it less stressful and course staff were all so kind. The only complaint I have is that assignments are open-ended and sometimes have areas of confusion/misunderstandings. One or two assignments were pretty brutal and took 20+ hours but others were very straightforward.,,
"Moderate time commitment of 5-15 hours for biweekly assignments.  Did not take COS217, but was able to complete all assignments successfully.  Good introduction to systems design.",,
"Chillest systems course in existence. No exams, five coding assignments and dean's date project at the level of a coding assignment. Probably the lowest workload departmental I have taken. Lectures were recorded which was awesome and the course staff was really responsive to student concerns and issues, extending assignments and cancelling assignment six. Psets are annoying just asking random facts from lecture, but no exams so its fine. Assignments are easier than 226 or any systems class and the graderbot gives you your grade immediately. Also shoutout to Julian for being an awesome preceptor/TA.",,
"This is a relatively easy but rather forgettable COS departmental. Would recommend taking if you want a manageable systems and you know some people taking the class that you can partner with. The assignments are okay; A2 and A4 in particular were quite painful but the late day policy is super generous. I would say the course staff were extremely generous and helpful, and Rexford and Levy are awesome and so knowledgable. It can be really really painful without a good partner, though. No final exam is great too.",,
"Overall, would recommend. The course staff is very nice, and lectures are good, and I feel like I understand more about systems after taking this class. My main complaint has to do with the assignments - the lectures were fairly conceptual, but the assignments were very hands-on, and so I often floundered a bit at the beginning of the assignment, not knowing where to start. I think they're trying to improve this for the future, though, so hopefully this will not be the case going forward.",,
"Interesting course taught by committed staff. If you need a systems departmental, I highly recommend it, even if you're not that interested in systems. They give you 7 late days, which are a great boon if you use them wisely. Other than that: Get started early on assignments. Get started early on assignments. Get started early on assignments.",,
"It's a pretty easy A but a lot of the assignments suck. The main downside for the assignments was that documentation/instructions were extremely unclear. Instructors were rarely available to provide clarifications on Ed. Half the time I felt like I was blindly writing code and hoping it meets the spec. The course assignments are uploaded via GitHub, which has an autograder configured to give feedback on which tests your code passes. However, test descriptions are vague so there is no clear way to fix your code to pass a test. You also do not get feedback from the grader if the code crashes while running tests so there is no way to tell if the autograder is down (which happened frequently) or your code is wrong. On multiple occasions I submitted code that passed some tests, made some changes that resulted in my code crashing, then falling back to working code and somehow still not receiving feedback from the autograder.",,
"It's an okay systems departmental. You basically have to teach yourself most of the content though, especially Go. They really need to work on improving the course structure ? they had to offer extensions on two assignments and fully cancel the last one because of poor planning. Could be a lot better than its current state.",,
Not very difficult,,
"COS316 is perhaps the least difficult upper-level COS course in terms of content and assignments. Take it if you need another departmental but don't take it if you want to learn about systems to a deep extent. It's a decent bridge to COS418, COS432, etc. Assignment specs are sometimes a bit vague and the GitHub autograder provides pretty minimal feedback, so office hours are definitely necessary. Assignments take anywhere from 3-12 hours to complete, and they're all in Go. The final project is not difficult, very open ended. Also THANKS JULIAN FOR BEING SO SO SO HELPFUL IN OFFICE HOURS!!",,
"I highly recommend this course. It is a great introduction to systems and covers a wide range of topics. Make sure to attend all lectures, as the professors are great and also because problem sets are closely tied to lecture material. Finally, I'd suggest starting early on programming assignments (after the corresponding precept) since some parts can take longer than expected.",,
"Good overview of systems, no exams! Highly recommend. Not too much of a time sink, especially compared to alternative systems departmentals.",,
"Rexford is amazing, Levy is decent. If you can get John Yang for precept do it, he's fantastic. Great COS departmental for your second systems course besides 333",,
"I really loved Jen and Amit. I am not referring to the quality of lectures here as I didn't really attend, but in terms of kindness and flexibility, they get an A+.",,
"Great overview of systems and more than manageable workload, would be helpful to take before more in-depth systems classes like OS or Distributed.",,
"The assignments can be a lot of work, but you'll typically eventually figure them out. They have really good late day and grading policies, plus there is no final which is a big plus. Might as well take this course for systems.",,
Allocate enough time per week.,,
"This course is actually quite easy because the professors  and TAs at office hours are really willing to help you succeed in the class. I personally am not interested in systems or the subject matter at all, but the course was still academically doable and engaging for me. One thing would be that while getting an A is very doable, the course at this point does not feel very organized, especially the assignments. If you need clarification and have questions, this course is definitely one where you will be going to office hours regularly, so please do so and you will be good for the semester!",,
"One of the easiest system requirements in COS department for sure. Prof. Levy and Rexford are great lecturers, very passionate about the subject matter. Make sure to go to precepts - they will help tremendously with the assignments. Start assignments decently early, so you can ask questions in office hours. Problem sets were reasonable difficulty and based on the lectures. Really appreciated that course policies were very lax - we could attend from Zoom, we were given many late days, and final project is not much more work than a normal assignment. Overall, loved the course staff and would definitely recommend taking before higher-level systems courses!",,
"This is a solid class, even if you aren't interested in systems.",,
"This is an okay class. You'll learn something about systems, but the assignments aren't significant enough to give you a real foundation. Some assignments do take a long time and the psets are good but test you on small details from lecture. Lecture was recorded so I would just watch them on 2x speed before the psets. Profs Rexford and Levy are so nice and understanding-- they were always interested to listen to students to extend deadlines and were attentive to student feedback. In addition, it was really nice to have late days, unlimited submissions and instant feedback on programming assignments, and no exams. But I would say that if you're looking to learn deeply about systems, take 418 or 318-- they're much more intense but you'll learn a lot more. Overall, workload was very light and topics were interesting though there are courses where you'll learn a lot more.",,
"Only take this course if you are a COS major looking for a systems requirement. In that case, this is a great course that gives an overview of systems concepts without being too challenging. The workload is very manageable and the instructors regularly pushed back deadlines and even canceled an assignment in response to student concerns. Make sure you have a strong partner and start assignments early so you can go to office hours if needed (assignment 2 is hard!!).",,
"Take it for an overview of systems at a very high level. Additionally, you can decent exposure to Go, which could be helpful if that's what you're looking for. Assignments aren't too bad, and problem sets are nice to keep you on track. Very easy systems requirement course comparatively",,
