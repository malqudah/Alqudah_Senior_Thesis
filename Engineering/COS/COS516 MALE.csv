Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Definitely go to office hours when you have questions - Zak is very approachable and will not make you feel dumb for not understanding some of the course material.,,
Nice class if interested in programming languages or logic. Do-able as an undergrad.,,
I would recommend to start on the project early and to go to office hours to talk about it often- this will likely give some great advice for whatever problems you are researching.,,
Consider taking this course if you're interested in improving either your theory skills or your knowledge of PL analysis techniques. It's a good way to satisfy the Theory breadth requirement.,,
Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in programming languages.,,
"Prof. Kincaid is very supportive and likes to help students. But if you don't have related background knowledge in this field before, you should consider carefully whether or not to take this course. You may have to spend lots of time on this course.",,
Exposure to proofs and mathematical language is recommended. Having some foundational understanding of logic would also be useful.,,
