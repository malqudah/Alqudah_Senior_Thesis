Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Good course to learn more about low-level programming. If you enjoyed ELE206 and COS126 you will like this class.,,
"Definitely make sure to go to precepts, as you learn a lot in them that you don't during lectures. Also, office hours are very useful for assignments.",,
"Take it but be prepared to spend a lot of time on it! Ask questions as soon as you don't understand, take advantage of all the office hours/Lab TA office hours and use Ed!",,
"It seems like changes are being made to make this course much more manageable than in the past. Personally, I found this course to be less work than 226.",,
"Must take!! Choose Donna Gabai or Christopher Moretti as your preceptor.Assignment 4 is the most time-consuming, so prepare for that.Assignments and exams are not so hard.",,
"Its a good amount of work, especially towards the second half of the course where you really have to manage your time if you don't want to be forced to use a late day on the second half of assignments. Overall, if you like COS, you will like the course  because you will learn a lot about C, assembly language, and even touch into machine language, but be ready to put some time into it.",,
"It's usually recommended to take this course after COS226, but I think if you found COS126 manageable, then this course should not be too difficult to take is before COS226.",,
I would advise students to start assignments early and don't hesitate to get help.,,
"This was, and I cannot stress this enough, the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Not just at Princeton-- literally ever. This class broke me down, destroyed my confidence, and in all honesty, I ended up switching my major from COS midway through the semester (though this was more chalked up to personal reasons, I can still say that this class had no hand in making me want to stay). If you thought the glorious structure of COS126 and 226 would be found in this class as well, you would be sorely mistaken. Precepts were very lacking. The assignments were genuinely so ridiculous. At least in 126 and 226 it felt like you were working towards a goal. This class just felt like you were coding to code with no real progress being made. And on top of that, you can literally end up failing assignments for style points even if your code is working perfectly fine. Also, the challenge portions were so frustrating since you weren't able to receive help at all (debugging, questions, etc.) and they were PART of the grade, not just extra credit. I didn't mind using C for this class, but it took me a while to get used to it since they just throw you in and have you figure it out on your own. Genuinely, the only shining light in this horrendous course is Donna Gabai. If you are taking this course because you are required to (otherwise literally don't), make sure you get Donna as a preceptor and go to her office hours whenever you can. She is an absolute angel and really helps you understand content and your code without making you feel bad (same with Scott Karlin). I went to the head instructor's office hours for code twice and both times, he was very passive aggressive and made me feel so dumb for mistakes I was making, even though I had never coded in this language before. I never went back to his office hours after that. In conclusion, no class has ever left me feeling so drained, so lost, so unmotivated, and so traumatized. If you have to take this course, I wish you luck and God speed.",,
"This class covers a lot of interesting and important material. The assignments help provide a more concrete understanding of the material and helps reveal what really goes on in a computer program, which I liked. The assignments can take quite a bit of time, so it is important to get started on them soon to spread the work out and avoid the stress of crowded office/TA hours before it's due.",,
Donna Gabai + Scott Karlin >>>,,
Start the assignments early and go to precept! You can probably get away with not doing most of the readings. This course was really not as bad as people sometimes say. I did well in this course and in 226 but preferred 217. Taking 226 before this course and having the extra programming experience probably also helped.,,
"I would only take this course if you have to. The content is not the most interesting and the course moves super fast. The assignments can also be really difficult and time consuming.  Get Moretti as your preceptor, he is fantastic",,
"If you're COS, you have to take this course. Overall, it's not that bad, just make sure to show up to lectures and precept. Donna is a great preceptor and very nice. I would recommend starting early on all the assignments and making use of office hours and lab TA hours. Often, they can quickly solve problems that would take you ages (and this will save you a lot of needed time on the longer assignments). I did enjoy this course though, assembly language is pretty cool and not nearly as bad as people say it is.",,
Donna Gabai is really good at explaining the concepts. Go to her office hours and get into her precept. She is simply amazing at teaching the subject. The other preceptors and teachers are also good.,,
start assignments early,,
Start assignments early,,
"Pay attention in precept. Also, some lecture material is literally never seen again so be careful of those of the final",,
This course is very fun! It's definitely a lot of work but it's worth it. Don't expect them to grade anything in less than 2 months.,,
"A very good introduction to systems; however, expect to work hard.",,
"Great course! Moretti really made the course what it is. Teaches you a lot of software fundamentals, although the language c is not extremely useful. It helps give you an understanding of ""why"" and ""how"" everything really works on a lower level like the compilation process, the terminal, different languages, etc.",,
Take it and be 100% engaged to get the most out of it,,
"Start assignments early and go to Prof. Gabai, Prof. Moretti, or Anne Kohlbrenner's office hours!!",,
"This is an interesting course that covers important material in a pretty clear way. Assignments are a bit tedious and can take a long time, but are generally well-explained and really relevant to the content. Another well-done cos class along with 226.",,
Donna Gabai is a LITERAL GODDESS and is fully the reason i passed this class.,,
It's a tough class. would say that debugging it definitely harder than it was in 226.,,
Well taught class. Do not fall behind on lectures/material/precepts and you will be fine.,,
Ok class. Lots of work,,
"A few of the partnered assignments can take a decent amount of time, but office hours is extremely helpful. Overall a good course.",,
"In this newly revised version, there are only 6 assignments (all of which are programming) and each takes 15-20 hours. So make sure to start on assignments quite early and pace yourself, doing it last minute is much harder since each assignment is much longer. Lots of support available and things taught in class are directly relevant so if you organize well you'll be doing well!",,
"Prepare to spend a lot of time on the assignments. The structure of the class is offset a little, but you will get used it. Office hours and lab TAs are very helpful! I was new to C but learned it quickly.",,
"Even though I am incapable of following my own advice, start the assignments early, save your late days until later until the course, and find a partner with late days.",,
"If you put time and effort into the course, you will learn a lot and be able to do fine on the assignments/exams. Take the opportunity to go to office hours / meet with preceptors outside of class if you're confused, because they're super accommodating and you will learn a ton. Additionally, I know this course has the reputation of being difficult/burdensome, but if you really engage with the material, I think it can actually be fun (coming from someone with very little COS experience!). All the preceptors are great, but I want to give a shout out to Donna Gabai - she was probably the best preceptor I've ever had at Princeton, and she was instrumental in my learning this semester.",,
"Stay on top of the lectures and attend the precepts, they will help clarify a lot of the information. Start the assignments ASAP, office hours become super bloated the few days before assignments are due.",,
"DONNA IS AN ANGEL SENT FROM HEAVEN. Try to get her as a preceptor - she will make the course material much easier to understand and has really useful diagrams to trace through code. Aside from that, she goes above and beyond by hosting and attending extra office hours for her students, literally helping to debug until 1AM. This course was pretty interesting but especially in the second half it speeds up so make sure you understand all the material during precepts/lectures so you don't have to suffer and play a huge catch up game during finals! Also make usage of office hours/lab TAs, they were definitely very helpful.",,
"Make sure to get Donna as your preceptor! And also start the assignments earlier. Don't be scared of taking this class, but you HAVE to keep up with lectures and not fall behind--that way, in precept, you won't zone out.",,
"Anyone who plans to work with computers and coding should take this class to understand what goes under the hood. Teaches the act of coding as a whole, not just limited to C & Arm Assembly.",,
"Imagine walking down elm, having a great day, until someone hits you with an 18-wheeler. That driver is the COS 217 staff. 95% of the time they are either unable to help or unavailable. The backlogs for OH are through the roof. The lab TAs are quite poor and lack the debugging and social skills needed in a client facing role. The only ray of sunshine in the dark depths of this abysmal course is Donna Gabbai. She is a GOD and is so kind and so willing to help.",,
"This course was pretty well-taught, though the pre-recorded lectures often sounded monotonous and as a result they were hard to follow (sometimes I couldn't tell if Moretti was being sarcastic). The precepts are really where I feel like everything comes together. Donna is AMAZING and I highly recommend doing everything you can to get into her precept section because she really helps break down the complex concepts (and actually makes them understandable!!) and draws very useful visualizations that enforce the material. Having a good partner for your partnered assignments is very important. Great academic support from preceptors and lab TAs. I certainly enjoyed COS226 more but I can see why COS217 is important - it covers a different area of computer science that is more low-level. Great to learn though!",,
"You're probably here because you have to be. Get started on the assignments early and just go to a course staff office hour to get help as soon as you need it, pretty much. There's a lot of bugs that are just unreachable for such hard and time consuming projects that this course will drain the mental health out of you, so don't get caught up running down wrong paths. File trees is the worst, but hey, good luck!",,
Really stay on top of the material!,,
"It's a lot of work, but if you manage your time well it is definitely manageable. Try to really understand what's taught in the first few weeks or else it will be a little difficult catching up, though definitely possible. Moretti is a chill preceptor. Overall class is aight, not too fun but you'll definitely learn some useful stuff.",,
"I think this class gets a bad rap. Definitely there was a big jump to make at the beginning coming from 126 and trying to learn emacs, but the projects were so helpful. I learned very very much from them and I feel like a better programmer. Get a text editor.",,
"Compared to 226, this course is not as fun nor as interdisciplinary. Algorithms are seen everywhere whereas systems is really a computer-science thing. You're prob taking this course for the CERT or departmental so just deal with it. Get a partner because debugging will take a huge chunk of your time. Also sometimes LAB TAs are garbage/useless.",,
"Pay attention in precept, it will really help you on the assignments. Overall, I really enjoyed this course - the lectures made sense and the assignments were challenging but doable",,
"Please please take cos 217 it's so interesting. Sometimes the assignments can be a drag (~12 - 20 hrs ish per) but the content is enlightening. I feel like in CS, they always talk about the ""1's and 0's"" or ""stackframes"" etc but after doing low-level programming in C and assembly it all makes so much more sense. Lectures were pretty good but you should go to precept because they go more in-depth with examples. Long story short you'll probably come out as a better programmer pog",,
Not much work for good stretches but then an absolute frenzy to complete the projects. Use office hours for any non challenge portion. They will help you think about the problem better and show tips to save time. Overall recommend. Course material is very useful.,,
"The course was designed very well and smoothly. I think that the difficulty stemmed from learning C from scratch, rather than dealing with the course itself.",,
Make sure to allocate enough time for the class.,,
"Make sure you go to lecture and precepts, and try to start the assignments a bit in advance since sometimes the lectures start going ahead of the assignments. Get a sense of how much time you'll need for the later assignments by comparing how long you take on the first few with the average reported time in previous years.",,
"Get ready to work! Donna is incredible, super helpful and dedicated to her students. Highly suggest having her as a preceptor or going to her offie hours.",,
"GET DONNA AS YOUR PRECEPTOR!! She is the most amazing person and is genuinely invested in helping students understand the course material. She made the course so much more manageable by explaining the material thoroughly and was always willing to help if you just email her. In terms of material, the course covers a lot, and assignments can take large chunks of time, so make sure to take it with a manageable course schedule.",,
Work hard and start your assignments earlier than necessary.,,
"This course is pretty good ? it wouldn't be my top choice if you're just taking COS for fun, but as a departmental/certificate course, it's pretty nice! Make sure to budget enough time for the programming assignments later in the semester because they are SUBSTANTIALLY longer than any of the first half of the semester's assignments and will take you by surprise ? or at least they certainly took me by surprise ? if you get used to budgeting only a limited amount of time for programming work (as I did). Other than the at times tedious, long assignments, this course is pretty well-taught! The course staff are generally really supportive and helpful.",,
"I advise you to watch all lectures carefully and take the opportunity to ask questions about them during the Q&A sessions. Focus during precept because it really enforces the things you've seen in lecture and sometimes goes into more detail. Make sure you really understand the assignments you do. If you receive help during office hours, make sure you understand that thing you needed help with so that you're able to do it on your own the next time. Really understanding assignments and what the course staff is hoping to accomplish with them helped me a lot during the course and also with exams.",,
"If you don't need to learn systems, I see no reason to go through such painful material. The faculty is great, especially Donna, but the material and work is long and tedious.",,
Take it only if you have to for COS/ELE. Assignments always take much longer than expected but the last few are fun. Moretti lectures were great.,,
"This course is unlike COS126 and COS226 in material, but like those two it covers a lot of skills relevant to being in CS. Highly recommend this class if you're interesting in learning more software development based skills and about things going on at the lower level.",,
"Be sure to spend time deeply understanding the course material/lectures. In hindsight, I wish I memorized these as I went along (as opposed to right before exams...). Also, be sure to learn the various programming tools (bash, Git, make, gdb, etc.) when they are first introduced. It will make doing the assignments a lot easier.",,
Not too much work in the first two thirds of the semester if you're familiar with C. Would recommend staying on top of the prerecorded lectures.,,
The course is pretty interesting and fun. It's easier if you do COS226 before COS217 because you'll get a good understanding of the data structures that will be covered in the course.,,
Very different from 126 and 226 but can be manageable.,,
"Great class! Just be mindful that estimated time for parternered assignments are average time for one person, not total time.",,
"This class is more manageable than I thought (except File Trees, please start that assignment super early andremember that every assignment after that is WAY better). As other reviews mention, Donna is a GOD. She is amazing at debugging and so dedicated and will help you work through all your issues. I liked it and found it pretty fun but it definitely is not as interesting as COS226 and a fair bit more difficult. At the same time, I was really scared off by the course reviews but I think the course is solid and the professors and preceptors are super helpful. It probably isn't that practical though.",,
"Make sure that you watch lectures corresponding to the assignments and review the precept handouts and attend precepts as they are very very helpful for the assignments. Also, DONNA MUST BE A SAINT, AND SHE MUST HAVE SUPER-POWERS! She was the most helpful, enthusiastic, and passionate preceptor I've had this year. Additionally, all of the course staff are very understanding, well-equipped to help, and supportive! This course was redesigned this year and has more core software engineering relevant material as well as teaches you to work as a real software engineer. Fantastic for building your confidence after COS 226 helped you get the internship in the semester previously.",,
"Moretti revamped the class so it's so much better than it was in previous semesters. You get to use Github which is super useful. Get Donna as a preceptor. Start the assignments EARLY. Starting from the Directory Trees assignment, the assignments will take 20+ hours. so start EARLY!",,
"This class is A LOT. I can't really imagine taking it during a non-PDF semester. That being said, it is manageable if you find a good, patient partner and start assignments 4 and 5 WAY before the deadline. Material can be interesting.",,
"Keep up with the readings and lectures. Otherwise, the assignments will be fairly painful.",,
"A great class! Really helped me understand a lower level / bigger picture of computer science. Assignments do take a decently long amount of time, but you learn a lot through them.",,
Start assignments early!,,
"Have you ever thought coding in readable languages was too easy? Have you ever looked at Java or Python and thought: ""Man it'd be a lot cooler if instead of letters there were just bits of 1's and 0's."" Well congratulations, COS217 is the class for you! Not only will you be writing in C, but you will also experience Assembly and MaChInE lAnGuAge. Instead of learning ""Hello World"" in one day, you'll learn how to meticulously do it in binary over the course of several lectures. What are you waiting for?",,
