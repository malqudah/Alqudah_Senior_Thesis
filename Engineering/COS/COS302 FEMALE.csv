Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"If you are interested in machine learning and do not know the math required to understand it, this class is useful but extremely difficult. It is my understanding that if you have taken mat201 and mat202, this class is not incredibly difficult. The Ed was often unhelpful and the office hours were not great in terms of accessibility. Take this course if you are interested in the subject material but I would not recommend it over another course.",,
"I took this course without having taken linear algebra or multivariable calculus. It was difficult, and I had to pdf. In many ways, the material spoke for itself. The problem sets combine concepts of linear algebra, probability, and multi with (what I thought were) engaging problems solved using Google Colab. While I had a hard time in the class, it made me understand exactly why linear algebra, probability, and multivariable calculus are useful and why I should take more classes to better learn these skills.",,
"I'm not even sure what to say about this class, but to summarize I'd say: disorganized. I've taken ORF 245/309 and MAT 201/202 and took this to refresh my understanding of those topics, and ultimately left the class with more opaque understanding of those concepts. The best example of this was lectures - I always left I feeling like I understood the material less. Precepts weren't particularly useful since the preceptor would generally go over some formulas and give us the rest of the time to work on the next problem set. Problem sets didn't help either - the wording was vague, the coding tended to be tedious, and the questions were either really easy or really hard. Most problem sets took between 8-12 hours, with the exception of 8/9 which took around 30 hours. Exams weren't inherently difficult, but were quite a bit off from the problem sets and lecture material. Much like in other classes, the exams required you to apply concepts in new contexts but, since these concepts were never taught well, exams felt very difficult and frustrating. Overall, I think the course could be greatly improved but would generally advise against.",,
The only practical thing I took away from this class was vector-based pythonic thinking. The rest of it was pretty dry math. If you need an easy COS departmental I did quite well without attending a single precept and going to a grand total of 2 lectures.,,
Do NOT take this class. It isn't used for anything and if you feel like you would learn something from this class then I strongly recommend taking/retaking MAT202. You'd be better off saving your time and watching a tutorial on how to use matplotlib on youtube - it covers the all the course content and more in 2-3 hours rather than 2-3 months.,,
"This is a math course! Be prepared for lots of math-y symbols and notation, they were quite intimidating for me. I would also suggest taking this course if you have some background in the math concepts already or prepping for the course ahead of time. Even though COS 126 and MAT 202 are the only prereqs, some of the material is not presented in an introductory manner. The assignments are interesting and challenging and LONG - set aside enough time for them.",,
Overall this course is not bad if you do well on the psets. Midterm and final are not too bad if you keep up with the class. Be prepared for a couple very difficult psets that you'll need to start extra early. All of the psets are required to be written up in latex which contributes an additional two hours to what should be 4-5 hour psets.,,
Stay on top of lectures and precepts because they will offer a great foundation in math that you'll use for machine learning courses. And ask many questions because Professor Wang and Ting-Han will address them very kindly.,,
"I took this class because of the positive reviews from a previous professor, but this ended up being one of the worst classes I've taken at Princeton. I usually go to all of my lectures, but these lectures were so dry and so useless that it was unbearable to stay in them. The lecture notes did not help with the problem sets at all and the TAs were incredibly unhelpful with conceptual questions. Please avoid this class at all costs.",,
"It was pretty obvious that the instructors this semester didn't care very much about teaching the course. I distinctly remember thinking before the midterm: ""if it wasn't for Prof. Adam's insanely high quality videos from last semester, I would 100% drop this course."" Unfortunately, even those videos dropped significantly in quality after the midterm (just in time for the drop deadline to pass, alas). Most questions on Ed never got answered. Lectures were confusing and often contained typos. Probability was the worst-taught subject by far, a shame because probability itself is a fascinating subject. The most tragic part is that even after spending 10-20 hours per pset, I don't think I learned very much. I learned how to ctrl+F the typo-ridden lecture slides, or the textbook, or Prof. Adam's videos, for formulas/theorems to survive the psets. I don't think I learned very much mathematics in the process.",,
"This class is really a review of linear algebra, calculus 1, and probability.  PSets take longer than you will think, and you have to Latex everything.",,
If you wanted good ml courses you shouldn't have gone to princeton.,,
"This course is great to whet your feet before taking a machine learning course, especially if you don't feel solid on linear algebra, multivariable, or probability. The homework exercises are also really interesting. Highly recommend!",,
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!,,
"This class isn?t terribly difficult in terms of math, and you?re probably not going to learn much useful if you?ve already taken MAT201, MAT202, and ORF309. But you haven?t taken one of those but still wish to take ML courses, then this would be a good choice (still would advice to learn linear algebra thoroughly though)",,
"If you're taking this course to brush up on linear algebra/probability for COS324, you probably don't have to. COS324 does a pretty in-depth coverage of all the math you will need in that course. While I can't speak to higher-level courses, COS302 added very little to my COS324 experience and was honestly the most difficult class I took this semester. I actually found it more challenging and harsh than COS324. Course staff were not particularly approachable, and assignments throw you straight into the deep end of whatever you were learning that week. The exams were pretty fair, but the late policy for this class was very unforgiving. In general, I can't think of any reason to take this course -- even if you don't know any linear algebra or probability, you can probably make it through COS324 with fewer headaches.",,
"Chaotic. This course was all over the place in terms of jumping around in content and the disconnect between in-person lectures, pre-recorded videos, and precepts. Problem sets and exams felt totally random and lectures did not completely cover what was tested. Offering 1 hour of office hours a week was never enough, especially when it was done over Zoom and the collaboration policy made it so that everyone had to wait 20 minutes for each person to go into a breakout room with the preceptor. Absolutely absurd.",,
"This course was only hard because it was so poorly taught. The in-person lectures were confusing, and the video lectures provided often covered different material than the in-person lectures. The problem sets are assigned sporadically (not to mention the fact that we had a double pset due the day after Thanksgiving break ended). The professor and TAs rarely answered questions on Ed. Overall the content is not that interesting as it is mostly a review of other math courses at Princeton, so I can't recommend it unless  you need a low maintenance math class for your major.",,
Only take it if you need it.,,
"The class covers a lot of topics but not very in-depth. It would've been nice to have had a more integrative approach/have an approach more focused towards application to ML rather than just an overview of topics that are useful for ML. The PSets are great, they cover some interesting topics and were maybe the best part of the course",,
