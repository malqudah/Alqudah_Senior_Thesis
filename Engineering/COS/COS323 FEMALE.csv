Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Difficult, probably having some proof-based math background before coming in would make it a lot easier",,
"Overall great class. Content was presented clearly and not too difficult. Learned some interesting things but a bit of repeat from other courses. Shen and course staff did an excellent job, very responsive and helpful.",,
"Would recommend taking it, really fun!",,
Much more emphasis on proofs than expected. Shen is great and super willing to help you understand the material. HWs were a bit tedious sometimes and in case you're considering taking this as a non-requirement be careful with the workload,,
"This class is amazing. The material was very interesting. It has some aspects of ORF 307, however, you go far beyond that. The programming was very accessible as there were examples from class and precept. Preceptors were very helpful in regards to programming, psets, and general questions. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's curious about optimization.",,
"Hated it. This is supposed to be the crown jewel of the orfe department, easy and interesting. Instead it was super proof-heavy, difficult, and had an 8 hour final at the end to finish it off. It wasn't even that different from any other class that has optimization in the title. Do not recommend.",,
Fun class with very manageable workload. Shen's really nice and a great lecturer,,
"Lives up to its reputation especially with Shen who is such a sweet person. Everything is predictable, well-defined, interesting, and still the right amount of challenging that makes it all worth it.",,
"This was a great course. Shen in particular was excellent. The assignments were well formulated/clear, and all the lecture/precept notes were super clear as well. This isn't the easiest class, but it's great because none of the work you do feels like ""bad work"" (eg, flipping through slides to find some obscure theorem, or trying to decipher poorly worded assignments, or dealing with poorly organized class materials, etc.). Take.",,
"Take it as early as you can (likely hard to get in earlier than senior fall, though), and be prepared for some work, but material not too overwhelming. You'll learn a lot if you haven't done much optimization, and will brush up / put together a lot if skills if you have.",,
"I know there were some doubts since AAA wasn't teaching this course this semester, but Shen is an amazing lecturer and tried really hard to make this course run smoothly. Lectures were really easy to follow and I actually felt like I was learning from them. Assignments were pretty interesting, especially in the second half. Would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested.",,
Shen is awesome. The course is likely easier with her than with AAA.,,
"This is the best optimization course at Princeton by a landslide. While most optimization courses here focus on a few methods as an application tool (such as to solve financial models), this course surveys many of the important ones, which is super helpful for putting all of them in perspective. A good mixture of theory and applications. If you enjoy optimization and problem solving, I cannot recommend this course enough. Also really helpful for other ORF courses like 311, so I would take this first.",,
"TAKE!! Shen^2 is awesome, as is this entire class.",,
"This course is challenging but rewarding! You have to know the concepts well to do good on the exams, especially since you will be doing proofs on these exams.",,
Shen is a great lecturer! Don't be afraid to take it just because AAA isn't teaching. Was still a fantastic course,,
