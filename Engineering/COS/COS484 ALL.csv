Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take this course! Lectures are very interesting, engaging, and well-taught. Professor Karthik and Professor Danqi are a super duo of a team. Homework assignments are thoughtful and align well with lectures. Workload is very reasonable (sometimes challenging, but very rewarding). I would say this is one of the best courses in the COS department. This is a fantastic intro to the field of NLP and you'll learn a lot!",,
"If you have any interest in NLP, take the class. Karthik is a good lecturer while Danqi is struggling with her English. But the programming assignments are really interesting! Every assignment you get to work on a small NLP application. It's the first time they teach the class, they did not curve it and gave a really heavy midterm. I hope in the future they have more realistic expectation of us. So if you're trying to defend your GPA, this course might not be right for you.",,
Would recommend taking to course for an introductory overview of ML in NLP.,,
"This class is incredibly hard and goes through a lot of content. The assignment instructions are often unclear and are very long and difficult. Although the course says that ML is recommended, it really is not and should be required. That being said, Karthik is an incredible lecturer! Very clear, concise, and to the point. Also is able to break down complex, mathematical ideas into bite-size pieces that appeal to intuition. Would highly recommend any class that Karthik is giving the lectures for!The TA Pranay was very helpful and patient. BUT, beware of the TA Willie Chang, who for this class was condescending, judgmental, and impatient. He was the reason why I stopped going to the only TA hours I could make. The majority of Princeton students' lives do not revolve around one class. And it goes without saying that most students' workload is heavy enough to not want an antagonistic TA in their lives. I'd rather have a TA who couldn't care less than a TA who's gonna treat me like I'm stupid and judge me for not spending all my time on the class when I show up for TA hours.",,
"I would highly recommend taking this course as an introduction to natural language processing. Definitely feel comfortable with core math and statistics (probability theory, expectations, integrals, derivatives, etc. etc.) and programming. If you don't have a machine learning background, that's totally fine, but for sure be comfortable  picking up a new language / framework quickly (specifically numpy / pytorch). While it's definitely not the lightest class to take, it's fairly run and gives you ample time for each problem set. If you know you're going to be busy in a week, start early and you should be fine! With the final project at the end of the semester, be sure to find a group you're comfortable with, since (as usual) the group you pick either makes or breaks your project experience.",,
"This is a great course! I appreciated the fact that I came out of the course with a very good idea of various topics in NLP. I'd say that the course is rather a survey of different topics in NLP, and I liked that a lot. I also really liked the assignments because working through the problem sets helped me understand the concepts. The assignments and lectures complemented each other very nicely.",,
"Very new course and you can tell. Useful and cool to see what exactly can be done with NLP. I don't feel like I have an extremely good understanding of complex topics, but I know the fundamentals now.",,
Spend more time in doing homework will help you learn much more about NLP.,,
"A great departmental! Super relevant and well taught. Karthik and Danqi are great researchers in the NLP field. I thought the lectures were good and the textbook we used was really good in breaking down difficult concepts and making them easier to understand. The class could be a bit difficult if you haven't taken a machine learning class before or aren't confident in your math background, but it was still very manageable. The final project was cool although a bit confusing/vague about what was in the scope of possible.",,
"This is a good class if you want to learn about NLP! The content is very relevant to approaches used today in industry, and the material was taught in a pretty straightforward manner. Assignments and the exam were on the hard side, but nothing unreasonable.",,
"Do not take this course. It is disorganized and attempts to cover too much. There was little to no guidance with the projects. If you are looking for a project course, take 333.",,
Kind of a nightmare if you've had no prior experience with machine learning. Extremely mathy and hard to decipher. Expectations for the final project were unclear and the same can be said for the midterm. We had no idea what to expect going in. Little guidance on the very difficult and time-consuming problem sets.,,
"In its current form, the course is exceptionally math-heavy; especially in the latter half of the course, it often seems more like a Theory class than an Applications. If you fall behind in lecture material, it will likely be very difficult to catch up again, as most material is cumulative and highly dependent on understanding a handful of complex formulas. If you have experience in machine learning, this barrier to entry will be more manageable, but otherwise you will likely find it extremely challenging. The course has a great deal of potential, and despite the hiccups in its first offering, the subject matter covered is fascinating, and I'm hopeful that the course's first-offering issues will be ironed out.",,
"Don't take this course. I know it is new and it has kinks to work out, but it was easily one of the worst courses I have taken at Princeton and one of the worst courses I expect to ever have to take. This course caused me ridiculous amounts of anxiety. It relied heavily on past experience with matrix calculus and somewhat advanced probability theory. ORF 309 should probably be considered a prerequisite. The lectures were generally unhelpful, readings weren't typically on-topic, assignments always had typos and bugs, the midterm exam was orders of magnitude too difficult given the rest of the written work given, and the grading on assignments was at times unpredictably harsh. If you want to take this course, wait a few years and see if they've figured it out by then, because right now, it's absolutely hellish.",,
Really try to pay attention in lecture and ask questions if you're confused. This isn't an easy class and things tend to snowball if you don't understand one slide.,,

"It's a good class imo, it's just not a class for everyone. If you're not experienced in ML related topics and aren't very good at math, this is not the class to start with. Try out 324 or an equivalent course. That being said, both the professors are very intelligent and care about the students and I can only see this course getting better each time it's offered. You just gotta put in the work because I guarantee it'll be hard",,
"This class is a great introduction/survey to important topics in NLP. Areas of current research are covered as well. The instructors this year (Danqi and Karthik) were great and very enthusiastic. Note that you will not get a very deep understanding of anything from lectures and assignments, but there is a project at the end where you can dive deeper. If you already know a lot about NLP it might be a little too much review.",,
Overall this is one of core course in NLP field. If you are considering doing research in NLP you should definitely take this course.,,
"This was the first time this course was being taught and it shows. The professors clearly care about the students, but they do seem a little inexperienced in lectures and in managing the class. The assignments are long and tedious, and instructions and preparation for the midterm was seriously lacking. With this said, I can see this course getting better and better each year, because the professors clearly care a lot and this was their first time.",,
"This is a challenging course, but well worth it. The topics covered are in depth and meaningful and the final project has a lot of good structure.",,
"Start the project before break when you can easily get help. We started during break, got stuck, and ended up scrambling at the last minute. Assignments are similar in style/length to COS324, but easier theory. Karthik and Danqi are great lecturers and very dedicated to the course. TAs were very meh, often wouldn't be able to help with certain problems because they weren't assigned to them. Superior to 429 in almost every aspect. Solid apps choice.",,
"If you are into DL applications and would like to learn more about NLP, take this course. Karthik and Danqi are brilliant lecturers, both with incredible research experience and very available to help. Plus this is the only course available at Princeton (as on Jan 2020) focused on NLP and with a good balance of theory and coding/application. The course needs some improvements as this was the first year it was run, but I am fairly confident the lecturers will be able to bring the necessary changes in the coming years. Quite fun overall but needs work, so don't take is as an ""easy"" class.",,
"This is the 1st year the profs are running the course, so some slack can be given. Even still, there are a number of typos, so had to watch out for that. Thankfully, professors and TAs were super responsive on Piazza so that was great. MidTerm was quite difficult but not undoable (unlike what some students would say), and overall it was a very enjoyable course. More clarity on the grading of the final project would be appreciated.",,
"This class in its first year was extremely difficult. I had no ML background, and while I learned a lot, I felt that it wasn't enough to keep up with the material. The instructors also lectured material at an extremely quick pace, and if you ever fell behind by one lecture it was very hard to keep up.",,
I enjoyed this course and it is a very exciting topic with many state-of-the-art methods only being discovered and published in the past few years.,,
