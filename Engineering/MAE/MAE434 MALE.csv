Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"If you have interest in controls, it's a good class to take. Might be a bit proof-y at times, but solid overall.",,
"Recommended if you hope to learn something interesting in the field of state space model and state feedback controller/observer. The lectures are well organized in details and psets are well written with fair diffuculty. It would be better if you had some background knowledge in the basic concepts of automatic control and linear algebra, which is one of the most widely used tools in the course.",,
"This course is a great course to take! The workload is manageable and the material is interesting. If you have any questions about homework,etc, Dr.Leonard and the TA are always willing to help. This course focuses more on the theory of modern control, but the theory is definitely understandable.",,
Very interesting material. Prof. Leonard is so smart and knows what she's talking about. The lectures are a little tough to get through only because she's a very soft-spoken/unsure lecturer but she's very friendly and eager to help. The final report is a little tough depending on how hard you go on it,,
Solid course for anybody interested in control theory. Problem sets and exams are fair and manageable.,,
Prof. Leonard is a great professor. Pay attention in class and take good notes and you should be all set for homeworks/quizzes. Office hours and reviews are very useful as well.,,
I highly recommend this course.,,
"A good class if you want to get a stronger basis in controls. Not as clear as Professor Rowley's MAE 433, but that might just be because the material is a little more difficult. Definitely pay attention in lecture because the textbook is not super helpful. There is a final project instead of an exam which allows you to explore a topic in controls that is interesting to you, which is nice if you'd rather do some research and write a report instead of taking a final.",,
Reading the textbook sections before lecture is helpful since they follow each other very closely. Homework and quizzes were very fair.,,
