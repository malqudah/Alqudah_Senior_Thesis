Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
I would highly recommend the course. Maria is an awesome instructor.,,
"Overall a decent class. Would recommend taking MAE 433 before this one, if possible, as a lot of the content is similar and having knowledge of 433 makes this class easier to follow. Lectures are hard to follow at times and sometimes steps are skipped in derivations. Would recommend looking through the suggested readings(s). Other than that, the class is actually not too stressful at all. Honestly, the workload is lighter than 433. Would recommend to people interested in control theory.",,
"Would highly recommend this course. Prof. Santos is a great lecturer with a lot of energy. Psets directly extend well-presented concepts from lecture and develop a solid understanding of the course topics. At the same time, the psets are actually reasonable to complete. The two quizzes were very well structured. The final project is flexible, fun and manageable.",,
"I really enjoyed the course. I don't think it is different enough from 433 to certify it as a 'must-take' course, but it is still good. I wish it covered more material beyond what was already covered in 433. It starts with state-space systems and ends with LQR, so is effectively a more in-depth review of the second half of 433's material. A bit more generalisation to include time-variant systems, and derivations of theorems that were glossed over in 433. The homework was either straight-forward or you had to know a 'trick' to be able to answer a question (which you could easily go to office hours for and they'd be glad to help you). Justin was a great TA. Maria was a great lecturer: her notes were very easy to follow logically, and she took care to make sure that she was conveying the material with great clarity. I enjoyed doing a final project vs taking a final - it allowed me to dive into the world of controls on my own and apply lessons from lecture. Chill class, negligible stress throughout the semester, great lecturer and TA.",,
"Challenging material, very rewarding if you put in the work",,
"maria and justin are great, i don't know if theyll teach this course again though.",,
"Great class - Maria was a great lecturer and super knowledgeable, and her lectures were probably my favorite this semester. That being said, I'm not really sure what the point of this class is overall - it covers pretty much the exact same material as 433, and I definitely don't think I'm more equipped to stabilize a system now than after taking 433. You see a bit more of the derivations in lecture, and the psets are a little more theoretical, however it still doesn't really go past LQR, and it's on you in the final project to really explore a new topic in controls. That being said, it was pretty chill, with manageable psets and doable quizzes. Still, I would only say to take this class if you're really interested in seeing some of the proofs that Rowley skipped over in 433 and/or want to go further on a specific topic for the final projecet.",,
