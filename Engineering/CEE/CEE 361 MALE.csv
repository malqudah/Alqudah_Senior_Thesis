Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
This course is so well organized! Would highly recommend.,,
"I recommend this course if it contributes to your degree, but otherwise it may be a lot of work and a tough extra class.",,
"Don't take the class unless you have to, since the workload is significant. Start the final project early.",,
Extremely useful for engineers interested in structural analysis. Serguei organized the course exceptionally well. The work is roughly divided in half between hand calculations and MATLAB.,,
"This class was amazing! A great introduction to FEM, and Professor Bagrianski is always willing to help if you have any questions on problem sets or the final project. The class was very organized, and I really felt like I was learning something new every week. I would definitely recommend taking this class!",,
"This class is great. The project is a great way to put all the knowledge together. Virtual instruction is not too good for the kind of material you are taught in this class, but it is manageable. Start the Psets very early and ask lots of questions during office hours. They are doable, but not easy whatsoever.",,
Take this course regardless; it's a great course with very clear structure,,
"This has been my favorite course at Princeton so far. The course is very organized and the textbook, lectures, and precepts complement each other well. There definitely is a large time commitment associated with this class though, with weekly problem sets and a fairly detailed structural analysis due at the end of the semester. Still, Professor Bagrianski was very helpful during office hours, so as long as you dedicate enough time to this course, it's definitely worth taking and I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in structures.",,
