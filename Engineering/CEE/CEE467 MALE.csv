Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Professor Draper is a very good lecturer. In this class you'll be introduced to the steel handbook and also engineering design. I feel like I learned a lot of topics that are prevalent in actual engineering in the industry. Sometimes felt a bit unorganized though..,,
"The problems came from the textbook, and we did example problems during class from the textbook, so you can mostly get by just reading from there. Also, it's good to learn how to use the Steel Manual early on.",,
"If interested in structural engineering, take this course! It is a great opportunity to enjoy an amazing professor, providing real world examples you can relate to, while learning in a very smooth and logic manner. Attend every class and you will miss it once the semester is over.",,
Prof. Draper does an excellent job of teaching and wants to see you succeed in the course. Assignments were reasonable and lots of support is available,,
Important class to take for CEE majors! Recommend if you're interested in structural engineering!,,
I highly recommend the course! Prof. Powell was a great instructor and the course was fairly straightforward.,,
Definitely take this class if you need an easy and enjoyable Engineering Elective.,,
Great course for structural engineers.,,
"If you want to be a structural engineer, please do not graduate without having taken steel design. The course was a good introduction to steel design but did feel like more of a survey course than very in depth. Powell is an excellent lecturer - even Monday night classes didn't seem like a drag when he was lecturing.",,
"Prof. Draper was very knowledgeable, but it is better to engage him about his experience. The lecture examples were out of the textbook and were only mildly helpful because of that. The problem sets were very manageable with the textbook, except for the last one that was very long and hard out of nowhere, so be forewarned. The class was manageable and the final project was a lot of fun to complete, though please do think and plan ahead.",,
"This was one of my favorite courses at Princeton. You get a good introduction to steel design and an excellent overview of the structural design philosophy in general. The workload is very reasonable throughout the semester, though it picks up at the end, so make sure you set aside plenty of time for that.",,
