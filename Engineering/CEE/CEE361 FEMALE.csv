Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Make sure to get help from Prof. Halpern and Zeyu (if he's still the TA). Problem sets are time-consuming, so start them early and ask lots of questions on Piazza. Pick something you are interested in for the final project, as this will take a lot of time as well.",,
"I think Professor Halpern is a great professor, she really cares about her students and wants them to understand the material. The material can be a little hard to grasp at times but as long as you follow the book and ask questions it is manageable",,
Not an easy coarse. The lectures are theoretical but the problem sets are practical.,,
Prof. Halpern does a really great job of teaching some very dense material! Office hours and precepts are very helpful and important to go to.,,
"Start the problem sets well in advance, with other students if possible, and don't miss the precepts",,
"If you're an MAE looking to fulfill your structures, do not take this class. It isn't horrible, and you learn interesting topics, but the work load is beyond excessive. Be prepared to spend 15-20 hours per week on assignments, and to have both a final (listed a midterm on the syllabus) and final project. Lectures don't help very much, so you will have to rely on office hours.",,
"The material in this course is not very engaging, and lectures are fairly dry. However, it is very well organized, the assignments are well designed, the exams are fair and final project is a lot of work but interesting. Take only if you have to.",,
Take it as your statics req if you can.,,
"It's a course with a lot of work, and the lectures are difficult to follow/pay attention in. Assignments were way too long, incredibly long, I had never seen assignments so long. Each of the assignments were the amount of work of 2 assignments, and it was very difficult to complete with the given time frame.",,
