Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
easy A,,
I would take this course if you want to learn about the core ways of optimizing,,
"Prof. Stellato and the AIs were all extremely caring and helpful people. They were helpful in talking through concepts at Office Hours, and set up additional time to meet and discuss concepts as necessary. The lecture slides are good, actual lecture tends to be an exact rehashing of the slides. Precepts are extremely valuable for problem solving. Rajiv is an amazing preceptor, although I suspect Irina and Vinit are also great (they are helpful during OH). Not sure that the class actually ended up covering much material - a long time was spent on various forms of least squares, integer, and linear programming, but the surface was just scratched with some of these. Psets are easy (only 3 questions, 4 hours of work max). The midterms are conceptual, you can never be sure of what to expect. The final is not too difficult, the entire 24 hours to work on it is generous. Grade distribution is very generous (45% of class gets some form of an A)",,
"Useful topic, hard material, especially if you haven't coded in Python before.",,
"Great course. Don't take if you aren't super comfortable with linear algebra. If you are, amazing.",,
"This is a pretty interesting course about optimization and you learn a lot about the applications of optimization in the real world. Prof. Stellato is a pretty good lecturer, although he may skip over the fundamentals of the more difficult concepts in the second half of the course, so be prepared to use outside resources to fully understand the material. The graders grade pretty harsh for homeworks in that they won't tell you everything they ask for in the question to get full credit and you have to guess what they want (should go to office hours and ask them if what you wrote is enough to get full credit for every question). Professor and instructors are pretty dedicated to teaching the course and are responsive to emails. Overall, a pretty good and interesting course.",,
get rajiv as a preceptor if at all possible - he's awesome!,,
"Rajiv is a great preceptor, and Stellato is a kind instructor who explains concepts very clearly. If you're an ORF major, you have to take this course, but don't fret, it's pretty useful and interesting. I will likely not take another optimization course, but that's just because I'm not that type of ORF major. This course made me want to reconsider that stance, so I guess it was pretty good. Learning Python is not that hard either, so don't worry.",,
"This is a required course for ORF majors, but it is an interesting course for anyone interested in optimization. It is a great introduction to optimization and the course staff is very helpful in teaching. Lectures aren't totally necessary, but I went to all lectures and found them really helpful in understanding the material. P-sets are only 3 questions a week and very doable (go to OH!!). Also, the in-class exams are very difficult but your grade will likely be fine in the end. Great ORF course, will take more optimization in the future!",,
Don't recommend it if you are not ORF. Lectures don't really prepare you for the assignments (which are light but tricky and hard if you don't know Python) nor the midterms (which were pretty challenging given the lack of study materials). Pretty boring stuff too.,,
"It is not the fault of Stellato or the preceptors that the material is a little boring, but they do a great job with a course. Stellato is really nice and his OH saved me, and the exams and assignments are very fair.",,
"Attend lectures, precepts, and office hours. These resources were all very helpful! Nice intro to optimization.",,
"Go to office hours. Lectures can be quite dry, and precepts weren't all that helpful, really just doing practice problems. Wouldn't recommend this class unless you're an ORF major and have to take it.",,
It is difficult conceptually,,
"Interesting and fair. Take if you need, but otherwise there are more interesting courses to take as well.",,
This course is just not super interesting.,,
Only take it if it?s required,,
"Go to precept and ask lots of questions! The weekly problem sets are pretty short and easy to get through without actually understanding the content sometimes, so make sure that you are actually staying on top of what you're learning because the midterms are difficult!",,
Stellato is very sweet professor and does his best to make lectures interesting. I personally enjoyed this course and found the material to be very interesting. The lecture slides were very easy to follow and the weekly assignments are usually quite light. Definitely make use of office hours if you need to. The midterms can be on the harder side but I thought the final project was really fun and manageable given the time limit.,,
Only take if it's required.,,
"I loved this course! The homework/psets are extremely manageable and Prof. Stellato is great! Exams were slightly hard but the grading policy was very generous. Even if you are not in ORF, if you are in any technical field, the skills you learn are pretty useful, and I found them interesting.",,
Overall a really good class that feels useful. Make sure you are solid with linear algebra or this class will be very very hard,,
"Solid course! Not too complicated or that much work, just make sure you keep up with the content every week!",,
Take it if you're an ORF major or otherwise interested in optimization.,,
"This is a solid ORFE requirement and it introduces the concepts of optimization and linear programming well. Lectures are boring, but problem sets are only 3 questions each and very doable with some help from office hours.",,
"This class was challenging but reasonable. While some exam questions were challenging, there were still a reasonable amount of questions that were very gettable after minimal studying. Don't worry about the final project. I am not a coder and did very well on it. Although it says its a 24 hour take-home, it really doesn't take that long, even for a noncoder.",,
Make sure to start the PSETs early and go to precepts since they are helpful,,
"Interesting class to understand different optimization techniques. Can be a bit tricky, so make sure you are really understanding the material well especially for exams.",,
Take and just be prepared to work,,
"Most people in this class are ORFE majors who have to take it anyway, so I guess there's no point in recommending for or against this course, but there is much less coding than I expected, and frankly, the problem sets aren't very hard. Be prepared to spend *some* time decoding the lectures, which can be a little confusing at times, but overall it's a fine course.",,
