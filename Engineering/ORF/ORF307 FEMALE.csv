Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
It's a great course not just for ORFE majors but for anyone who wants to learn how to solve optimization problems across a variety of fields.,,
"The final project was interesting in that we learned a little bit about machine-learning, but it took SO long to wait for the models to run (as with most data science). Still the information was generally very applicable compared to the introductory ORF courses.",,
"Professor Benson did a really good job at trying to make the material more engaging than it unfortunately really is.  We covered topics such as the simplex method, parametric self-dual method, network optimization problems, Ridge and LASSO regressions, and transportation problems.  You learn to code in AMPL, which is a language I probably will honestly never use again when Python is available, but nevertheless somewhat helpful. Weekly psets probably took 2-3 hours (after watching the recorded lectures on 4x speed).  Although the final was kind of long, it was graded super generously given the circumstances of the coronavirus.  She is a visiting professor though, so can't really tell how it will be next year.",,
Professor Benson is great,,
LP is kinda boring and tedious but it's important so you gotta roll with the grind. Benson passes the vibe check but only teaches once in a blue moon. Get excited to program in a language straight outta the 80s!,,
"This course is definitely a lot of work, but the material is very interesting, despite being very time consuming. Professor Benson is a great teacher; it's sad that she is only teaching this semester, though. I heard Vanderbei is pretty chill, though. It is a departmental, so you have to take it if you are ORFE major.",,
"No reason to take if you're not an ORFE major tbh. Class was pretty easy this semester, but I don't think that'll continue going forwards. Benson is a very good teacher, but the material is ~so~ dry.",,
"Prof. Benson was great! She posts videos of lectures online (even before COVID-19), cancelled the first midterm and shifted the grade weighting to help us, and held extra office hours to accommodate time zones. Preceptors were all very good as well. Definitely one of the better taught and easily graded ORFE classes I've taken. Not as math/theory-heavy as most ORFE classes.",,
"This is a pretty course. It's pretty straight forward and not too difficult -- Prof. Benson is a good lecturer, but an even better professor, meaning that she was kind, understanding, intelligent, and reasonable. Whenever I had questions, she was happy talking with me at office hours for as long as it took for me to understand the concepts, even if this meant going over time. She truly cares about her students and WANTS them to succeed, which isn't something you get a lot. The homework can be monotonous, but it's also interesting. You're answering relevant questions and doing cool stuff with AMPL. Overall, I'd get the course a 7/10 grade, but I'd give Prof Benson a 10/10 grade.",,
great,,
"Unfortunately, Professor Benson only teaches the course once every 7 years, but taking it with her was probably the best one could hope for. She teaches well, manages to keep the lectures interesting, and is understanding when it comes to assignments. Made the class not too bad! The material naturally builds on itself and has some really cool applications. Overall a good ORFE course.",,
"Hande is an absolutely sweetheart and very kind and reasonable throughout the entire COVID situation. You learn some useful stuff. You are probably just taking this because you have to, and it isn't the best and was not very well taught or well organized, but I think having it with Hande was the best possible version.",,
Take notes during lecture,,
good course. orf has to anyways,,
"You have to take this if you are going to be an ORF major. If you are not, there's really no point in taking it as it's not a very interesting class.  The material is a bit dry and repetitive, and not something I can see myself using a lot outside of the class.",,
"Hande Benson was great.  The book is a bit higher level conceptually than you need, so look to lectures to help solve problems",,
"Take if you have to. The concept of optimization is interesting but this class doesn't explain it all that well. You learn a bunch of techniques without ever really learning why you're doing what you're doing or knowing when to apply which technique. It's a decent survey course but does not help your deeper understanding of the material. That being said, the assignments were fair and the exam/project were doable, but very time-consuming.",,
A really good introduction to optimization! Interesting applications to the real world,,
It's a departmental and you have to take it. But you get what you put into this class. Problem sets can take a while to do.,,
take it with this prof if possible,,
If you are ORF you have to take it. It's not a bad course and you could tell Professor Benson was trying to make it a good experience.,,
"Not too bad for an ORF requirement. Pretty interesting content, although having to learn to code in AMPL is a pain.",,
"A good introduction to optimizatin and linear programming. The course overall is not too hard compared to other orf/math classes and sometimes felt a little slow. Professor Hande was always available especially once online, but her lectures were quite dry and hard to pay attention to. The weekly psets aren't too hard but AMPL is a pain to deal with. Fine to take this class with orf309 if you are worried about that.",,
Take only if it sounds interesting.,,
Kind of a tedious course but not difficult. Has interesting applications but software AMPL can be annoying to use.,,
"This was a truly terrible course, and a phenomenal waste of time. If ORFE majors are required to learn how the simplex method works in excruciating detail (by hand), English majors should have a class on writing long essays by hand and then spell-checking them with their eyes. Totally useless. Sure, teach us the math behind network problems, but I really really did not need to learn how to write the arithmetic behind pivoting in the simplex method over and over again. Over and over and over. I do not care how the simplex method works, and I don't think I should. If it's that important that ORFE majors graduating from Princeton understand how the simplex method works, teach it in week one and then move on and forget about it.Also, the textbook is absolutely horrific. Has this guy ever seen a textbook before? Ever asked himself why his is the only one that's a tiny little paperback? Because everyone else realizes that a textbook is not a compilation of random musings on a nonexistent topic, it's an organized resource that uses background explanation, theorems, and example problems (with solutions), followed by exercises. Also, ever wondered why this is literally the only textbook on the topic? Because it's a useless topic! I learned close to nothing in this course, and that's coming from someone with about a 97% average. It's really a shame that hundreds of my ORFE brethren and I have lost so many hours of our lives to this class, and I hope that future classes are spared.(Professor Benson was wonderful, but she unfortunately had to step into a course that was doomed from the start)",,
"Prof. Benson was truly amazing this semester. We all appreciate her excellent teaching style and ability to explain things in precise manner especially with intermediate steps. All assignments and exams were fair game and even enjoyable. Unfortunately, she only teaches every 7 years at Princeton.",,
"Prof. Benson is an excellent professor, always willing to help and good at explaining concepts. The nature of the material can be quite dry but she was very fair with grading and assignments/exams, especially with the COVID situation. It's really not too difficult as a course as long as you do the assigned work and pay attention. It's unfortunate that she won't be teaching the course next year since she was a great professor and always made herself accessible to students.",,
"Take this with a grain of salt because of the COVID/ZOOM semester.  Prof. Benson is amazing and too bad she won't be back again.  ORF307 is not very hard and honestly pretty intuitive.  Whether ORF or not, I'd recommend this class to everyone because of the usefulness and relative ease of the class.",,
"Linear programming is a very helpful skill. Unfortunately, this course suffers from several problems. There's a good amount of busy-work like performing the same algorithm on many problems by hand. Assignments that were interesting were hindered by being spoon-fed AMPL models that only required minor changes to work on assignments. Lectures were slow but not any clearer to compensate. Lecture slides and in-class notes were on separate PDFs, making them difficult to reference. While the final project wasn't particularly difficult (this time, instead of being spoon-fed the AMPL model directly, it's now in words for you to translate--also not hard), it was fairly interesting. Unfortunately, we were only given the week of reading period to start and finish it, which would not have been a problem if we didn't have to train a support vector machine several times. This course would have been much better with less busy-work and less spoon-feeding. Less frequent homework with less repetition of algorithms by hand that is more challenging would have been so much better.",,
"Obviously only take this if you need to. This course is as bland as everyone says it is. However, I must say that Prof.Benson was able to make this course bareable.",,
"ORF concentration requirement. Pretty straightforward course. The final project is a data recognition model, which is pretty cool. Find people to compare homework answers with, since it's very easy to lose points on small mistakes. Homeworks are pretty tedious and take around 5 hours per week.",,
"Good course overall! I would start the final project pretty early, although I don't know how long it will be in future years. Most of the learning of the material comes from the homeworks, but I would go to lecture as much as you can.",,
