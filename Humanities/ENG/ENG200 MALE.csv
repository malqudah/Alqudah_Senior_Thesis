Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"A great class to get a broad survey of some literature. Professor Lewis's lectures are enjoyable and humorous at times, and himself is personable and approachable. Do the readings (or listen to their LibriVox recordings), participate in precept, write the essays, and you'll likely be fine.",,
Go to office hours for advice on your papers.,,
"I would definitely take this course, whether it is a distribution requirement or a course that interests you. The readings are not too difficult if you take the time to analyze them but the preceptor will also help you if needed. The Preceptor that I would recommend is Mr. Toscano. He will always make the time to help you with the course as well as any help/comments on written assignments.",,
"Prof. Lewis is super engaging and funny, try to get into his precept too! not recommend if you're first year bc readings can be challenging at times. be engaged in precept tho and always watch lectures; they are genuinely interesting even for someone with 0 background knowledge or passion for english lit like me.",,
"Lots of reading but almost none of it is ""required."" Very interesting and manageable class.",,
Take it. Duh.,,
"Lectures and Precepts are important. They help keep you on track. If you attend them, and read of course, you shouldn't have a problem.",,
"This is a good english class. Professor lewis is a great lecturer, his insights are very interesting. The coursework is straightforward and clear. The workload is light for most of the term -- only three 500 word reading responses total. 8pg final paper and final exam is more work at the end of term, and they're together a huge chunk of the grade, which is stressful. I would recommend this class",,
"TAKE IT!! AWESOME reading list and Prof Lewis's lectures are so brilliant and really make you think about the deeper meanings of all of these literary works. Pasquale is an awesome preceptor too, really kind and understanding!",,
"Take this course if you're genuinely interested in English literature and history. The assignments can be quite challenging, especially the readings and the essay assignments. The majority of the weight of assignments falls towards very end of semester. Would not recommend if you are just looking for LA.",,
A ton of fun and not hard at all. Highly recommend.,,
would not recommend; take if nothing else fits but assignments aren't on anything from class (not sure if this is normal for an english class) but i would steer clear if you can. pdf is chill though,,
"Try to keep up with the readings, even though it may be tempting to skip some. You do not have to read everything, although the course is what you make of it, so try to read as much as you can.",,
"I think the fact that Rhodri is British greatly enhanced my enjoyment of lectures. This was a fairly reasonable class; I think it's basically true to the course description. Some of the assignments came out of nowhere, but the workload is reasonable (except for basically two final papers :0)",,
"Do the readings, ask questions and get paper feedback from preceptor",,
"Take this course! The workload is very manageable and the content is interesting. Even if you aren't thinking of being an English major, this class provides you with a solid understanding of English literature which can teach you a lot about life and give you an interesting perspective. Professor Lewis is awesome and genuinely so kind. Worth it!",,
"Professor Lewis is really kind and funny-I will admit that some of the readings are a bit tough, especially in the beginning with Canterbury Tales and Paradise Lost, but Professor provides great context and analysis and is always willing to help.",,
Take this class if Rhodri Lewis is teaching it!!! He's incredible and so engaging.,,
"do not take this course! Prof Lewis does not care about the class at all, I learned nothing, and we had a paper AND a final which was just a second paper. I had a miserable time",,
"It's a fine survey class. I don't think it rewrites the world, but take it if you need to.",,
