Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Not the most exciting. Pick something different. I was thinking to be an English majro and now I don't want to be because of this course. Papers are graded weirdly, more on teachers' opinion than your actual analytical capabilities. Much attention is giving to mere words and phrases that are used in a way contrary to the preceptors' opinion, rather than attention being devoted to chunks of analysis. If you go to less than half the lectures, but go to all the precepts and submit your essays to your preceptor three days before the deadline so they can give you feedback and you can resubmit, you'll get a B.",,
Do the readings!,,
"Professor Gee's lectures are insightful and engaging. She rambles sometimes (think over ten minutes of largely irrelevant historical background), but her lectures are overall rewarding. Andrew is a very helpful preceptor if you make the effort to go to his office hours. The three midterm 'exercises' are essentially 2 page papers, so you need a fully developed argument as with a regular paper. This is a very end-heavy course, with a final paper and a take-home final, so a lot of your grade will depend on the last two weeks of the semester.",,
This is a good introductory English course. The lectures are relatively interesting but they move quickly. I did not really end up using my notes later in the course so it might be best to simply listen to the lectures and take minimal notes as opposed to trying to get everything down. The reading is pretty manageable if you stay on top of it.,,
Do all of the readings and make the effort to form connections between the works. They have so much to teach us alone and even more to teach us in concert!,,
Keep up with the readings of the text. Keep track of ideas as you go along during the semester to prepare early for your final paper. Ask your preceptor for help if you need direction with papers.,,

Professor Gee is a very good lecturer and makes this topic incredibly interesting. The assignments aren't very difficult and relatively short. Highly recommend for a nice LA.,,
"This course is a great introduction to the British novel and the English department as a whole. Be prepared to became a lot more comfortable with reading Middle English out loud and doing extremely close readings of texts. Professor Gee speaks about the readings with a lot of passion and it is clear that she has spent a lot of time pondering each one. Try to get her as a preceptor if you can, she poses great questions and is super supportive when its comes to writing assignments (which there aren't that many of).",,
