Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Keith Wailoo is a fantastically intelligent and engaging lecturer. This course covers the history of drugs in the US in a very unique way: by looking at the intertwining of drugs and race. The content is very interesting, the lectures are a must watch. Even though half of the course was virtual, I found myself wanting to watch the lectures simply out of interest. TAKE THIS COURSE",,
"Super interesting course, would definitely recommend if you are willing to put in a good amount of work. Just be aware that there are a lot of readings, and the papers are a lot of work because they also require that you find your own primary sources (esp. the last one which is 12-17 pages)",,
"It's interesting and engaging, do the readings for precept",,
Very interesting class do not worry if you cannot finish all the readings there is still a lot to learn,,
"Interesting course on the intersection of race, drugs, and drug policy. Lots of reading and a pretty long final paper, but the actual content was interesting and cool to research. Take if you are interested in this topic!",,
Highly recommend! Lectures are super engaging and detailed. Very good course for anyone interested in American history and modern politics. Be prepared to do a lot of reading.,,
"TAKE THIS! Will change the way you think about drug debates and challenge you to deconstruct your preconceived notions about drug addiction and criminalization. No matter what major you are, this is such an informative and interesting class. 11/10 recommend.",,
"Take it. I loved every minute of it. Professor Wailoo is brilliant and supportive and a fantastic lecturer. Lots of reading--and I totally recommend doing all of it, but you don't absolutely have to. The grading was fair, and the professor and teaching staff go to great lengths to make it fair across the board. The research papers give you a really good opportunity to go deeper into the parts that really interest you, which I loved.",,
"I would definitely recommend this course. There are a lot of readings, but it really isn't necessary to do them all to get a lot out of the course. Focus on reading the major books and doing a good portion of other readings, and lecture and precept should make sure you get the major themes of the course. Professor Wailoo is a legend and his lectures are super interesting and engaging.",,
"Too many readings, good survey class, good PDF class.",,
"LITTLE to no talk about Black people and the carceral system; don't take if you want to talk about black people and their stake in drug policy; DENSE readings and LONG papers. Final was ALOT because the final exam and final paper are both pretty dense; I felt very overwhelmed in this class. This class focuses on the history of Drug policy, so mostly based in the past. But with that being said, you do learn about the ways that identity influences policy and nuances the preception of drugs.",,
Start writing a response to the question before the end of lecture. You will run out of time.,,
"This class covers really interesting material. That being said, the lectures are kind of overwhelming and the readings are completely unreasonable. I ended up taking it pass fail, and still enjoyed listening to the lectures, but had I been stressed about a grade it would've been a lot. Overall, interesting class, but not the best execution.",,
"Decent course. Tons of readings and grading is kinda harsh. If you are interested in the topic, I would probably just watch some documentaries on Netflix and avoid this course. But also I PDFed so ?\_(?)_/?",,
"Don't take this class unless its for PDF. As a chemistry major, the content was interesting, but there were SO SO many readings that were so long and often times irrelevant. Precepts are fine if you do the readings, but the lectures are TERRIBLE. The content is so disorganized and you jump around through history so much its confusing. Keith also is so pretentious and name drops constantly its so annoying. Also my preceptor graded super harshly despite the fact that grading was supposed to be ""more lenient"" due to COVID-19 and never really explained what was expected of us.",,
"Take this course!! Be prepared for a lot of work - but if you're interested, its worth it .",,
get wailoo as your preceptor!!!!,,
"This class, content wise, is definitely one of the most interesting, relevant, and rewarding classes at princeton. However, it goes way too hard in my opinion in terms of papers & exams (I generally think it unofficial expectation to have EITHER a final paper or a final exam: this class has both and you will feel that in your bones by the end of the semester). I learned a lot in this class, so for that I appreciate it. But it certainly might become a point of stress in your life.",,
"Very interesting topics and readings. Lecture's are mostly good but a bit all over the place, with very disorganized slides. One specific note is I don't think there was a single lecture that ended on time.",,
"TAKE IT!! Prof. Wailoo is such an amazing lecturer. Try to get him as your preceptor too if you can (Monday morning section)! Grading is fair, readings are sometimes a lot but really engaging, lecturers are fantastic (but word of caution, can run overtime). Take it !!!",,
Great course to PDF. Content is really cool.,,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH A 5 COURSE LOAD. There are solo many reading at leat 200+ pages and it's very hard to get finished, also lectures almost always run late so don't schedule another class right after the lecture. The class itself was very interesting but I would suggest taking it with a lighter course load.",,
A lot of readings!,,
"There are so many readings to get through, try to take the class with a friend and divide up the readings to do together. They are very worthwhile in enhancing what you learn in class and vital to precept participation! Get started on the writing assignments early, it was helpful for me to look at sources early on and think about what I could write about as my thesis and then get the essay done in a week.",,
"One of the best courses I have taken at Princeton. Best lectures I have ever attended. The course is difficult, requires a lot of reading, but is ultimately really rewarding. Harsh grading though, might want to PDF it if you are taking it for general interest.",,
Keep up with lectures in order to contextualize the readings.,,
a lot of reading and not as cool as expected,,
The topics are interesting but be prepared to challenge yourself.,,
I would say to always be up to date with lectures.,,
"This course has A LOT of reading, about half of which is actually interesting. Lectures are ok. Interesting content, but poor presentation. Basically just reads primary sources to us for 30 min. Slides are also really overwhelming/unorganized. Some of my friends dropped the class bc they felt they couldn't keep up with the speed of lectures-- needed to take notes to make sense of the messy slides for future reference AND answer a question of the day that was due at the end of class. Take for the content if you are particularly compelled by the description. Writing the essays was pretty fun.",,
"If you really engage with the course, you'll get an A",,
"Amazing, very high-quality lectures. Wailoo is an expert in the field and makes any time frame seem interesting. If you're curious about the place of drugs in US history and how it relates to race and politics, take this class! (side note, I loved the gentleness in which LSD was spoken about <3 )",,
"This course is much more work than some people have said. It can pay off, but there are just three big assignments so not a lot of room for error. However, very interesting and relevant subject matter.",,
Really interesting course. The readings are the main consumer of time for this course but were interesting and modern,,
It's a lot of work but you learn a lot from it! I would recommend anyone with interest in drug policy take this class,,
"Be aware of the amount of readings. The writing assignments felt disjointed to the skills and topics covered in the class. Prof. Wailoo is very passionate about the subject matter, take if you are very interested in the subject matter! Not an easy A and not a good fifth class.  Definitely a class to shop though to get a feel for before committing to enroll!",,
Be prepared to fall behind on readings. It is simply the nature of the beast.,,
Pretty interesting stuff. A lot of readings.,,
"Awesome course, eye opening, and incredibly relevant. Lots of reading but very engaging and interesting. Highly reccomend as an elective or just out of general interest",,
good class to PDF and interesting material,,
Don't try and do all the readings if you can't! Also don't feel the need to take notes on every slide during lecture because they are posted online and you will be better off just taking in the information. Be prepared to have to think critically and outside the box.,,
"Take this course if you need a history class and don't love history. I wouldn't say it's an easy A, but the material is really intriguing. I loved the material, and I don't love history. The papers aren't necessarily easy, but there isn't a lot of work other than the papers. It's a really great course that helps you learn a lot about the world and teaches you to think in new ways.",,
"Take this course if you're interested in the connections between social standing in the US and drugs. It also has tons of fascinating connections between government, academia, drug development, and more. Definitely do the readings for each week because they're heavily talked about during precept. It is quite a bit of work but totally worth it!!",,
"TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It is 1. incredibly interesting, relevant, and important. Everyone regardless of discipline should take this class. 2. It is entirely what you make of it, but it isn't going to kill you if you don't make it your #1 priority. 3. great lecture quality and material selection. My advice would be to pay attention to lectures and go to every precept (Sally was so helpful and knowledgable!) Just skim all of the readings first because they are so interesting you will want to read them all but there is a lot of long material assigned (especially if you are a humanities major like me with lots of other reading every week). Corona times had me messed up so I didn't take enough advantage of being fully engaged in the class, and I will be reading some of the material over the summer lol",,
"I would recommend this class if you are deeply interested in drug policy, but I do want to highlight that it is a history course. You will learn about the changes and continuities in drug policy, but the focus is not on contemporary drugs (and only a few lectures toward the end touch on Reagan's war on drugs and after). The course ambitiously begins with the colonial period and goes up until the present. I would not recommend it if you are looking for a more Woody-woo oriented course. Also, beware there is a ton of reading and significant independent writing. Professor Wailoo is a great professor, but the lectures were a bit disorganized.",,
Be prepared to do a lot of work and reading and to sort through the material yourself.,,
"This course deals with a very interesting topic and Professor Wailoo is a great lecturer. However, the course is a lot of reading, so keep that it mind when taking the course. You can get by with skimming the readings. Also, there is a big 12-17 page paper due on the last day of the semester (all primary source research) which can also be time intensive. The course is interesting but relatively demanding in its workload.",,
