"Professor Cordero is outstanding. She is one of the most sympathetic and understanding professors on Princeton's campus. She is so dedicated to accommodating students and their needs. Course is a super interesting topic and will expose you to how scientific racism is engrained and pervasive in our society. Also, the workload is very manageable. Take this course!!",,
This course is amazing! It's engaging and Prof. Cordero really truly cares about her students. This class is also especially useful for pre-health majors out there interested in dismantling medical racism. I've learned so much about how scientific racism manifests itself today and what I've learned in this class will be instrumental in my future,,
A must-take. Professor Gutarra Cordero is the sweetest professor at this entire university and the material you learn about will change your perspective of the world,,
Professor Gutarra Cordero is amazing and her classes should definitely be taken!,,
Absolutely take this and every other course offered by Guatarra Cordero. The amount of care as an individual beyond the classroom is beyond amazing and she really acknowledges the struggles of being a student. This class was the best I've taken in my Princeton career and I am so sad that this is the only Cordero class that I will be able to take. It's absolutely amazing and really asks you to engage in contemporary historical understanding and analysis. Absolutely 10000000/10. You cannot go wrong.,,
"Take this class! Professor Cordero is probably the best professor at Princeton. The material is always engaging and it does not just lie in the past, but we are able to engage in contemporary sources such as movies and music videos. Professor Cordero is also very encouraging and caring. Her class will always be a safe space. If you are interesting in the material, there is no reason you shouldn't take it.",,
