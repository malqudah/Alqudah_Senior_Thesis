Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Decent amount of work, but fantastic content taught in a sequence that will change the way you look at the world and leave you with a wealth of knowledge in the subject (and the other areas that it impacts). Very good as a PDF class if you don't want to do that much work, otherwise, hopefully not too hard for a B+/A-",,
"TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Students will often conflate the quality of a course with its difficulty, and as a result discourage others from taking harder classes. This class does require a lot of weekly readings, but the midterm paper is a doable length (5-8pp) and while the final paper *is* lengthy, if started early it is also doable The papers require you find primary sources which initially seemed daunting, but once I got the hang of what key words I needed to put into the portal to find the sources I wanted it became super fun. You really get to be in control of your learning on the papers and you end up becoming very knowledgable on a niche intersection of many drug-related topics. The final exam will feel like a breeze if you pay attention to lectures and do at least most of the readings. However, the class is SO interesting and well taught that you'll find absolutely no problem doing the readings, paying attention in lecture, and participating in precept. If you can, you should def get Prof. Wailoo as your preceptor!!",,
"go to lecture, ask questions",,
"It was a great class, would recommend for a distribution requirement.",,
Definitely take this course if drug policy is of interest. The readings can be a lot but so long as you stay on top of your work you will learn a great deal and find the course incredibly engaging. Professor Wailoo is a wonderful lecturer.,,
Awesome course! It's a lot of reading but it's actually so interesting and useful.,,
I would recommend taking this course if you have time to really be invested in it as it is very interesting and thought provoking. Would not recommend taking it as a fifth class as you will wish that you had more time to get more out of the class,,
"TAKE IT. Amazingly interesting, awesome professor, and overall one of the best classes you can take at Princeton. Workload is there, but reasonable for the course.",,
Do the readings!,,
"I took this class PDF and it is a TON of work at the end of the semester so if you are taking for a grade make sure you are ready to grind out a 12-17 pg paper and do a final exam at the end. Other than that, Keith is by far the best lecturer I've had here and even as a MOL student I was super engaged in all the lectures. I actually thought having him as a preceptor also helped me understand the concepts better but once again if you want good grades you're gonna have to game this class.",,
Do the readings and attend lecture,,
"If you have to take a history class, there are many better options. This course was extremely time-consuming and not very worth it in the end, in my opinion. The two papers are doable and were actually my favorite part of the course. But the lectures and readings were truly so boring and hard to understand. I think the lectures need to be more organized and focused on synthesizing information across lectures. The course just asks a lot of students without much payoff.",,
It was a really interesting course.  I really enjoyed it.,,
"I really liked this class! It was pretty much exactly what the title says, and that's a good thing",,
