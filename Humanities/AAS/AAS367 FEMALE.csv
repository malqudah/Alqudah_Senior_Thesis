Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
You probably are gonna take this for a requirement of some sort or because you just want to learn more about black history. It's decent. Taylor talks alot so expect to be asking questions for your participation grade. The papers didn't always have the most clear guidance and honestly I got confused by her grading because sometimes I thought I put a lot of effort in and still would get the same grade.,,
"Professor Taylor is insightful, knowledgeable and engaging. The structure of the class (~ 30 students) isn't the most conducive to Professor Taylor's teaching style, but overall a really great class.",,
Make sure you are on top of the readings; it makes the writing assignments much easier.,,
This course is lead by a very knowledgable instructor who takes the time to explain crucially relevant information throughout each lecture. Take this course if you can.,,
"Its an ok class. Make sure to take ample notes and stay engaged during class.Also make sure to spend time on your papers. Prof is nice, understanding and funny. If you love history and are used to history courses, you would enjoy this class",,
"Definitely take this course, especially if you're interested in learning about this country's complex history with racism.",,
Great class to take whether you're new to AAS or a returning student! The readings were interesting and daily discussion engaging.,,
No advice.,,
Take this class!,,
"The content of this course is absolutely essential for all Princeton students, but this is not a introductory course: prepare for seminar style discussion and lectures, analytical writing assignments, and a good deal of reading. Highly worth it: Professor Taylor is brilliant.",,
