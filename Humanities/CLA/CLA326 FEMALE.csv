Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This course is terrific. You will learn a lot about Late Roman Republican history, and the course itself is not too much work. Professor Flower is an awesome professor and one of the kindest faculty members you will likely ever meet at Princeton. I would highly encourage anyone, no matter what their area of academic interest, to take this course if it is offered again.",,
Prof. Flower is great and approachable. Take advantage of meeting with her and hearing her input.,,
"Definitely take any class Professor Flower teaches if you are interested in Republican history.  She knows her stuff and is a fantastic, kind professor.",,
"This course changes from year to year, so the advice I'll put here is to start early - especially on the final project, as a lot is weighted towards that in this iteration of the course.  In terms of backbround, it is not necessary to have extensive prior knowledge of the time period studied, although it is certainly very helpful.",,
