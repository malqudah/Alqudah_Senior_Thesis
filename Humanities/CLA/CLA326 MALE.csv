Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take this class if you are interested in the classics! Very, very manageable workload. Around 50 pages of reading at most a week, a very fair midterm, and a 10 page paper as final.",,
I suggest to skim the readings (secondary source first) and keep a little notes document where you write down something to say in class. He likes participation and this is a good way to take away the stress of being in that 3 hour class without being able to think of something on a spot.,,
"Take careful notes in class and you will be good, even if you do not know anything about ancient democracy.",,
"I strongly recommend taking this course even if you're not a classics major. Prof. Domingo does a phenomenal job of taking those students with literally no knowledge of ancient history and making them think like classicists. This class was thoroughly enjoyable, readings were super manageable, and I genuinely feel that I've learned a lot about a topic I previously knew little about. Take this class.",,
"Even though this is a 300-level seminar, this course might be challenging to someone who has not taken a class in ancient Greek history. Brush up on the historical context of the readings each week and be sure to take the time to go through each reading carefully.",,
