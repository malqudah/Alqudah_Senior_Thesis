Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Do all the readings,,
"Take this course, the workload is reasonable and it is interesting while not being a huge stressor.",,
Very good course. The lectures were extremely engaging. Exams were easy enough. Great class for anyone looking for a history class.,,
It is a good distribution requirement and a very interesting class overall. Really helps broaden your understanding of Roman history.,,
Great course. Not too much work and the content is interesting. Caroline Cheung is also a great lecturer who is very approachable.,,
"This course is very interesting, although it is not simply a high-level look at Roman wars and politics. The course gets pretty nitty-gritty into day-to-day Roman life, and it also focuses on how history is written and the quality of sources.",,
Very good lectures. I  used a PDF on this course and had a great and not too stressful experience.,,
Definitely take this course.,,
"I absolutely adored this class. Fascinating topic, quick readings, and a very welcoming precept environment. Highly recommend!",,
Excellent course! Take it!!!!,,
Take this course. It is a manageable and interesting course. Also very well taught.,,
Course was definitely manageable. Lectures are not mandatory but be sure to keep up with the recordings.,,
"Super chill. Took this as a fifth course in freshman spring with my other bse requirements and it was a breeze. Lectures basically cover the most important things, so if you attend those you will be fine (even if you don't do the readings), but even if you don't go, you can just do the readings before midterm/final and you'll probably be fine as well. But I highly recommend going to the lectures because professor Cheung makes the topic super interesting. Exams were super straight forward (includes ids, multiple choice, and some essays for the final). Might be hard getting a full score because the grades for the short response questions were kinda vague, but you'll definitely be in the A range.",,
"I would recommend this class in a heartbeat. Professor Cheung is so nice, and the preceptors are amazing. This class is not difficult, if you put effort into it and show up for lectures.",,
"This is a good class! I definitely learned a lot from it. If you're looking for a good HA to pdf like I was, this is a good one to take.",,
"It a decent course. A very broad overview of the period. If you are looking for an in depth look into the Roman empire, this is not the class. Prof. Cheung was very nice.",,
"Great course! Professor Cheung is an incredible lecturer. Very engaging and interesting. If you have ever had an interest in ancient Rome, take this course!",,
"A pretty laid back and interesting course. Not a lot of work during the semester, but has a final paper and exam so that's pretty annoying at the end.",,
This is a solid course and pretty easy. It is more about the culture of Rome than the chronological history of the Roman Empire though. River is an awesome preceptor and will make the class much better.,,
N/A,,
Recorded lectures are very helpful,,
Go to class.,,
Take this course if you're interested in Rome and want a course that isn't an outrageous amount of work!,,
"recommend taking. interesting course, lectures can be a bit dry and unnecessary but as long as you study for the midterm/final with the review sheet you will be fine.",,
TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Cheung's enthusiasm about the content really makes lectures engaging. Not too much of a workload either!,,
Prepare to be kinda bored but still graded hard,,
Reach out to your preceptor with questions ahead of any papers and make flashcards to remember ID terms for exams.,,
Loved this course! Would recommend,,
Fun class on the Roman empire. The second half is a bit more thematic and talks more about Roman life. I enjoyed the precept readings (primary sources) and Potter's textbook: I wouldn't say they are necessary to do well. I would at least skim through the precept readings though so you feel more confident in participating. If you go to lecture and follow along with the content you will likely get some A: they have your back.,,
Take this course.,,
"Great course, good history distribution. Highly would recommend taking it.",,
This is a great course to take if you want to gain a deeper understanding of what it was like to live in the Roman Empire. Prof. Cheung is very engaging and considerate. The recorded lectures were really helpful with taking away the stress of attending every lecture in person or falling behind due to illness.,,
Do the readings and attend lectures and you will be fine. Nothing is meant to fool you or trick you.,,
"If you are looking for an easy 5th course, take this course! Professor Cheung makes lectures fun and story-like. The exams are reasonable, especially if you attended lecture and took notes.",,
Definitely take the class if you have an interest in the subject!,,
I would highly recommend students take this class. Professor Cheung and River are amazing and are always available to help. The material was quite easy to understand and the exams and papers were not too difficult to write.,,
Take this course! The professors and preceptors are flexible and it is easier than most courses to balance.,,
Take it without hesitation,,
recommend,,
"The course work towards the end of the semester starts to pile up, so I'd recommend starting the essay as soon as possible. This is a very interesting course that goes over the big moments in Roman history and teaches you to critically analyze primary sources.",,
