Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take this course, the information is interesting. Lecture are mandatory but fun so that shouldn't be an issue. Molly is a great preceptor!",,
"Great class! Prof Padilla Peralta is a great teacher, although this is very much a survey course",,
"Role plays are meh, but the lectures can be pretty interesting. You only get anything out of the course if you put in effort and do the readings, but grading is chill if you?re just in it to pdf.",,
"If you are interested in Roman history or need a history, take this class. It's fun and not that hard, and Professor Padilla Peralta is a fantastic lecturer.",,
Just do the readings and participate in precept. The class is so much fun and you'll definitely enjoy it.,,
"I can't recommend it enough.  It's a great and very detailed look into Roman history.  May be harder if you aren't as interested in the subject, but I really enjoyed this one.",,
"If you want a pretty easy and alright distributional requirement, take this class. There is a lot of reading to do, but preparing for the quizzes and exams were not bad at all. The first half is basically learning all the history while the second half is about certain themes, at least when I took this course. I definitely don't regret taking this course as a distributional and as long as you prepare the information ahead, the grind isn't that bad.",,
"Great course. A bit of history everyone should know about. I would say this a pretty decent easy A, although like all courses here you just need to memorize a few things and you will kill it. Professor absolutely loves teaching and you can tell how passionate he is about the subject. Absolutely worth getting your HA with this course!!!",,
"Keep up with the readings as it can be difficult to catch up once you've slacked. Overall good class with great content. Professor Padilla is a wonderful lecturer and you'll definitely learn a lot about Roman history. Also, only having to meet once a week is a plus.",,
"Lots of lectures are role plays which are a lot of fun (but very chaotic), and some of the readings were pretty interesting. Also, we were told about every question on the exam in advance which was nice.",,
"The course was my highlight of my semester. Professor Peralta is very well renowned as a professor and knows exactly what he is talking about. The lectures were very well engaging, and the preceptors were amazing answering any questions that students would potentially have throughout the semester. Make sure to have Molly Horne as a preceptor, she is the greatest to ever do it! DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",,
"Peralta's a wonderful lecturer (Google his personal story!), this is an optimal introductory history class, super fun. Get involved in the in-class roleplays! And Keegan's a great preceptor, warm, funny, and knowledgable",,
"It's a great course, but it will take some effort. Talk to your instructors and really immerse yourself in the material to get the most out of this class.",,
This is a great class. Do the readings.,,
As a BSE student I definitely recommend taking this course if you have any interest in the Roman Empire. Very cool history to learn. I was sort of planning on PDFing from the start unless my grade was high. Maybe not the easiest history class available but probably one of the most interesting ones. Role-plays were really chill too,,
"This was an easy and enjoyable class. Take it if you want a 5th course, for the distribution requirement, or out of general interest!",,
Don't skip readings,,
"you should take this course, because it is both interesting and important to know:)",,
Precepts are genuinely interesting. Do attend.,,
Do the readings and take notes during precept,,
I would say try to read your readings as much as you can and have questions for precepts.,,
Excellent course & really well taught! Molly was an excellent preceptor!,,
"This is a fantastic course! I'm not great at history, but Professor Peralta helped make both lectures and precepts (hope you get him as a preceptor, too!) enjoyable, lighthearted, and engaging. Do make sure to stay on top of the readings, especially since class only meets once for lecture and once for precept.",,
Take if you have a background on the topic and are very interested in the material,,
Take it if your interested on the Roman empire,,
"This is an excellent course.  Roman history is full of fascinating people, events, and narratives--and history is truly taught as a story in this course.  Professor Peralta is a very engaging lecturer.  You will be exposed to incredible primary sources and texts that you might not otherwise encounter.  You will learn how to read and interpret Roman art and artifacts.  The focus of this class is not memorization and regurgitation of historical happenings, but analysis.  Yes, you will come away with a greater appreciation and understanding of Roman history.  But you will also come away with a greater appreciation and understanding of how to assess and analyze primary and secondary sources like a historian.",,
Great class. Would recommend. Be ready for lots of group role-plays in the lecture.,,
"do all the readings, pay attention in lectures",,
