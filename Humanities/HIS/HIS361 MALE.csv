"I took this course in spring 2021, and it was one of my favorite courses all semester. Professor Zelizer is very well knowledgeable, and it was really interesting to hear from him on the recent events such as the buildup of the BLM protests, the beginnings of political movements,etc. etc. I have taken US History courses in the past, but I think this by far had to be my favorite one. I think that the readings made the class what it is since they were very fun to read and discuss in precept. Ask questions, pay attention, and you'll do fine! Strongly recommend for HA/History departmental requirement. Also try to get Preceptor Schwartz, he is amazing!",,
Be sure to do the readings and come to precept prepared with several talking points. This will make the discussion more enlightening and engaging for everyone involved.,,
"Take this course if you want to learn about recent US history (from a political perspective). The class helps explain how we got to the era of Trump, among other broad trends, and the lectures are very well organized.",,
"This is a really easy class.  If you are someone who follows the news closely and is familiar with the period, don't waste your time.  For everyone else, it will be a bit of learning with not much work.",,
Great course to take. Extremely interesting History requirement. The workload was fair and manageable online however the Dean's date paper and Final essays meant a lot of writing towards the end of the semester.,,
This is a great class that really puts modern politics and social trends into context. Zelizer is a great lecturer and the readings are engaging. Ideal history class to take.,,
"Do the readings because not only are the books great, but they are necessary for exams.",,
It's more of a civil rights history course than what it's described it as. Wild that there wasn't a single reading on 9/11 and the Global War on Terror which has defined a generation of Americans.If you enjoy reading memoirs and want to learn more about different social movements definitely take this class.,,
"Take this class! Professor Zelizer's lectures were really interesting, and Brad was a great preceptor. They are both so cute. Workload is very manageable. I wish I could've taken this course in person.",,
"Strongly recommend, great readings and manageable work load",,
"Kind of fun to do the readings. Lectures are pretty good, learning modern day US history is interesting. I think Igor is a harder grader than the other preceptors.",,
great lectures; super interesting class!!,,
"TAKE THIS COURSE! A number of alumni told me you must take it before graduation and they were right. Learned so much, Prof. Zelizer rocks, grading is fair, solid amt of work but doable.",,
Take this course! Professor Zelizer is great. The lectures are very interesting.,,
"This class had one of my favorite syllabi ever. Very fun books, and very interesting discussions. I will note that Professor Zelizer decided to have both a final and a final paper in the middle of a pandemic semester and unprecedented stress levels, which was A Choice.",,
Great reading list and a good way to learn about the modern era of politics in the U.S.,,
Watch/attend all the lectures! Take note of influential people/moments for use during the writing process of your essays!,,
"the course has about 150-200 pages of readings each week but they go relatively quickly since theyre more casual, being biographies. The writing assignments aren't bad themselves but the time constraints do make it a little tough to manage. If you do the readings and watch the lectures you should be fine for these though",,
keep up with the readings and have some thoughts about connections between lectures and readings ready before precept.,,
"I really enjoyed this class. The readings can be a bit much at times, but Professor Zelizer makes the lectures really interesting and fun.",,
"Interesting course! Definitely expect to work hard, as you will be pushed on your knowledge of the readings in depth during precept and examinations. I highly recommend you take this course if you want to learn about the context behind much of the divisiveness we see in our country today.",,
I recommend this class. It helped me understand how our world came to exist the way it does today.,,
"This is a great course to learn about recent U.S. history. As an international student, I wanted to learn more about the historical roots of social/political developments today, and this course definitely helped me do that. The readings are also amazing; they are all memoirs and books that you would want to read anyways (e.g. J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, Michelle Obama's Becoming) and I loved discussing them in precept. Caroline Matas is also an AMAZING preceptor -- so kind and insightful and engaging -- definitely try to get her if you can! However, I do feel like it would be hard to get an A in this class if you are not a history major; they do not provide that much guidance on how to write an excellent history research paper/responses to the exam questions and some of what they are looking for is rather discipline-specific. It's also not the easiest of PDFs in terms of workload since there is both a final paper and a final exam, but I still found it very manageable and enjoyable!",,
"Interesting lectures about a period in US history you often don't get to explicitly learn about! The readings were also cool and pleasant to read since they're all memoirs. I found the grading on the midterm to be a bit difficult but not too bad. One thing that was a definite drawback was the format of the midterm/final exams were changed due to Covid, so they were just essays. Although we had about a week to do the midterm, you had to take the final exam (meaning write 2 1000 word essays) in one 8 hour block, which was really difficult and annoying.",,
"Take this class. The readings are interesting and quick reads. The readings come from authors of different view points, so you are analyzing both sides throughout the semester.",,
If you are interested in American History take this course!,,
Do the readings!,,
Take this course if you are interested in modern history and politics in the US - a great course for those whose APUSH class skimmed through the history that is most relevant to our lifetime.,,
"Professor Zelizer is super knowledgeable and gives great lectures, and the reading list is great. If you are already familiar with recent history and politics, you?ll be chilling but also learn more so it?s not a waste of time. DO NOT TAKE IGOR?S PRECEPT.",,
Solid course on modern American history! Take it if at all interested!,,
"Take this class! Professor Zelizer is a great lecturer, and the content is super interesting and relevant. The readings are really interesting and provide a lot of different perspectives, and I finished the class feeling like I had a lot more context for the current state of American society and culture. Highly recommend!",,
"Take it, it's a great course. Trust me, you do not understand recent events as much as you think you do. The course traces a very clear path from the political environment of the 70s to today, and with all of that in context, our current political climate seems inevitable rather than anomalous.",,
"This class is phenomenal. Professor Zelizer is a fantastic professor and delivers engaging lectures. The readings (all memoirs and podcasts) contextualize history and make learning about the past very relevant to our current culture. I cannot recommend this class enough. Great class for history majors especially, but also for students of all majors.",,
"Really interesting course and Zelizer is a great lecturer. I found it to be quite helpful in framing my understanding of current events. The readings are mostly memoirs. While at times it can be overwhelming because it?s a book per week, I found them more engaging than traditional readings for history classes. Beware, not an easy A - especially for the writing assignments",,
Take this class! It's really interesting without being too difficult. Dr. James is a great preceptor!,,
Definitely take this class. The readings are way better than most history courses: they're all memoirs that are really fun to read.,,
"After taking Professor Kruse's class (US History 1920-1974) in the fall, I thought it would be great to continue this learning with this class, and I had thoroughly enjoyed Professor Kruse's class. Unfortunately, this class definitely fell short of my expectations. It was hard to get a clear sense of what exactly were the main takeaways from this time period in American history. The lectures were sometimes hard to follow because they were all pre-recorded and there were no powerpoints/outlines or anything to follow along with. If the class were in person or if the lectures were done live, I think this would not be as much of an issue, but because you can't ask questions, it just felt that the material would get boring and confusing. Maybe it's just this time period that seems a bit more boring than what happened from 1920-1974. It is not a super high stress class, you have to read memoirs every week, there is a written midterm, a 5-page paper, and a written final exam. Not super stressful, but just not super engaging. Take it if you want to learn more about this time period, but don't expect anything grand.",,
"I LOVED this course. The memoirs and lectures really informed my thinking, both on the time period specifically and on history in general. Prof. Zelizer is a gem. Take this!!!!",,
"Good course, interesting ideas. TBH readings were good, but not as good as they seem in the course description.",,
