Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This is a fantastic course. If Prof. Zelizer keeps the readings as memoirs, definitely take it. The books are so interesting and are fast reads. If Dylan is a preceptor, get him!! He is so fantastic and helps you feel so much more comfortable with the material.",,
"Take this course!! The readings are fascinating, the lectures are phenomenal, and the papers aren't too bad. Professor Zelizer is amazing, and this is a great HA.",,
Take this class! Professor Zelizer and all the other preceptors were very nice and supportive and the memoirs we read were super interesting and great reads!,,
"FAVORITE COURSE AT PRINCETON. Get into Prof. Zelizer's precept if you can. All the readings are memoirs so they are readings you actually want to do, the lectures are incredible, and precept conversations are fun. Absolutely take this class.",,
"20/10, Take this course, Professor Zelizer explains US history likes its a story and he perfectly intertwines the cultural movements in with the political history to create a full picture of each decade. Readings are all memoirs and add to this picture by bringing in the personal reflections of famous actors (Steve Martin) to iconic feminists (Gloria Steinem) to political actors (Michelle Obama). This course was a beacon of light throughout the pandemic and I couldn't be happier with my choice of taking it and engaging with the materials.",,
Take this class--it is engaging and you actually learn stuff.,,
Such a great course especially for non-history people. I took this as a BSE student and was able to learn so much and participate a lot in precept discussions. Prof Zelizer gives great lectures and the workload is very manageable. There is a decent amount of reading but the books are all very interesting.,,
"Professor Zelizer is amazing, the preceptors are some of the best, the material is interesting and not very challenging ? highly recommend!",,
Take it!,,
Take this class,,
Keep up with the lectures in order to write compelling essays.,,
Take this course! It is an awesome overview of topics that most high school classes do not cover. Reading memoirs is such an enjoyable and eye-opening experience.,,
TAKE THIS COURSE. One of my favorite classes at Princeton. The readings are awesome and Professor Zelizer is an incredible lecturer. Try to get in his precept.,,
Go to lectures - that's where you get the core information/course material. The readings are really interesting and definitely pretty easy reads even if they're long and they serve as a really great supplement to the information you get from lecture.,,
"11/10 course. Professor Zelizer is an amazing lecturer, and the preceptors were great.",,
"TAKE THIS, I took it just for his req but I feel like everyone should really take this course, it covers the more modern history that high school just didn't teach, and I was dumbfounded by some of the things we covered that I didn't learn about and were not covered in high school. The lectures are amazing really, and I think this has been the only class I've taken where I've really loved the readings, which are all memoirs. The extra guest lectures Professor Zelizer made for us about history relating to corona were also really amazing. I'm really glad I took this course and everyone should take it or any course with Professor Zelizer, he's just a great professor",,
LOVE!! Such a good course and so interesting. Go to lectures and do the reading and you will get a lot out.,,
"This is a really interesting course. The readings are memoirs not history textbooks, so they are much more fun to read than in a typical history class. Professor Zelizer is a really great lecturer and does a great job of presenting the material. I highly recommend this class, but be warned the grading on the essays is harsh.",,
"Make sure to actually do the readings because they're fun - don't be intimidated by the 200 pages a week as they're memoirs, not heavy academic texts, so they go by fast.",,
A must-take course to better understand the issues that have defined American history since the 1970s into today.,,
"Take this course, whether for the HA requirement or out of pure interest (which is why I took it). You'll get to read memoirs written by lots of interesting people and it'll help you understand the more immediate and recent historical trends that have led us to where we are today. The workload isn't too heavy, but the professor and preceptors are kind and approachable should you need any support.",,
"Take it. It's not too difficult, and it provides some insight into the history your parents experienced. Maybe it'll give you something to talk about at the dinner table.",,
Really awesome course! Professor Zelizer is a great lecturer and the readings in the course (all memoirs) give great historical context to discuss in precepts.,,
"Zelizer is a fountain of knowledge, and his presentation of the subject matter is top notch. Very enjoyable class. If you enjoyed being challenged, then this may not be the course for you.",,
"Amazing class, not too difficult and really interesting readings! Found it to be super enjoyable and definitely recommend taking it",,
"PLEASE take this course. Everyone should have a basic knowledge of recent U.S. history to understand what's going on now, and this course helps with just that. This is a great choice for non-History majors as well. Zelizer is fantastic and the lectures were always engaging.",,
"Wonderful class, Professor Zelizer is engaging. Will Shultz (preceptor) was very encouraging if you are shy to participate",,
"Echoing the other reviews of this class, Professor Zelizer is an amazing lecturer who really tries to engage students with the material. Additionally, this class increases your appreciation of memoirs because you learn the relevance they have in contextualizing history.",,
highly recommend,,
Very interesting course,,
"Stay on top of the readings, attend lecture.",,
Title of the course is misleading. Heavy focus on feminism/equal rights.,,
Amazing course with an amazing professor! The content is all extremely relevant to today and understanding the current political climate. Prof. Zelizer also put together an interesting speaker series about the pandemic when we went online.,,
Dylan is an amazing preceptor!,,
Would definitely take! Will is an awesome preceptor and the professor is nice as well.,,
"Super interesting course and very relevant to our current political state. Professor Zelizer is a great lecturer, but this course moves very fast. I now feel very informed about the rise of conservatism and partisanship which has molded current legislation.",,
"I felt that I could routinely answer questions about the shape of american politics and culture because of this class.  It's a good HA and would recommend it to others from a STEM perspective. The readings are pretty engaging and overall educational too. You'll learn a lot whether you already know american politics or not. The class was pdf only for spring 2020, so I can't comment on the grading, but overall it wasn't a difficult course.",,
Go to lecture and participate in precept.,,
Take this course! Amazing! Professor Zelizer is one of the most amazing professors I've ever had,,
"Take the course if you are interested in the political history of the last 50 years.. If not, you probably won't find it interesting.",,
Read throughout the week and participate in precept.,,
If you have questions ask! Professor and preceptor is very willing to help and take extra in OH.,,
"Professor Zelizer is a great lecturer and really cares about the class; he made an extra effort to find guests to discuss historical perspectives on current events with us during the time when class had to be online due to coronavirus. Overall, this class has interesting readings (all the books are memoirs) and really puts current events into context.",,
"TAKE THIS CLASS! The material is incredibly interesting and applicable to real life and Professor Zelizer is incredibly knowledgable! the workload is very manageable. Your weekly assignments include reading Becoming (Michelle Obama memoir), Hillbilly Elegy and other interesting reads. I am a STEM major who was in two labs and I was taking this for the distributional as my 5th class. The workload was super manageable and I often found myself wanting to read the books for this class. Both preceptors (Gottlieb and Schultz) were awesome! I cannot stress how much I've enjoyed this class, TAKE IT!!!",,
TAKE THIS COURSE!,,
Such a great class! The readings were great books and so refreshing from other classes. He makes it super interesting. A great HA and super enjoyable!,,
A great class! Applicable to everyone's life in one way or another,,
"Lectures were like story time, I loved it. 100% recommend this course if you want to learn about recent U.S. history and if you want to understand how US politics has changed in the past 50 years to what it is today. Professor and preceptors are fantastic and always willing to talk to you about anything. Think it's a must take class for everyone.",,
Take this class if you have any interest in modern US history! Lectures are interesting and the weekly reading assignments were recent autobiographies (like Becoming by Michelle Obama),,
"This is, hands-down, the best course I have taken at Princeton. I looked forward to every class and just loved every minute of it. Zelizer is an incredible and engaging lecturer. TAKE THIS CLASS",,
