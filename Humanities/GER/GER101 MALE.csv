Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Definitely take this class. The German department knows what's up. They're all phenomenal teachers, and the class is very engaging. The curriculum is organized based on the most commonly used grammatical structures and vocab, and if you know English, you're halfway there. It's an awesome language, and the professors really know how to teach it.",,
"Take this course! The most well structured course, so well taught, and very fun! You learn so much and will be inspired to keep learning German! Could not recommend it more!",,
"Phenomenal intro language course. German is a fascinating language. Pace of the course did not feel rushed either. There is nightly homework, but I never saw it as burdensome.",,
Professor Rankin is a great professor who will really help you learn German quickly. Best language course I have taken at Princeton.,,

Take this course if you want to learn to speak and read some German even after one semester,,
"Professor Rankin might very well be the nicest person (not just professor!) on Princeton's campus. He such a great teacher and understanding of the students' needs. I was struggling to keep up, and he made the time to meet with me separately. He cares about your success as a student and as a person",,

"This is a great course if you want an introduction to German. It is a lot of work, but very rewarding. The immersion teaching style works really well.",,
"Dieser Kurs war mein Lieblingskurs in Princeton. Professor Rankin hat einen tollen Kurs gegrundet. Er hat einen Plan fur jeden Tag, und man lernt viele neue Informationen jedes Mal. Ich habe nicht nur Deutschlesen und Deutschverstehen gelernt, sondern auch Deutschsprechen und kulturelles Verstandnis gelernt. Auch ? vielleicht besonders fur das Pandemie-Jahr, aber ich denke auch fur ein normales Jahr ? ich habe mich uber diesen Kurs sehr gefreut, denn ich habe jeden Tag fur eine Stunde mit ein paar anderen Studenten gesprochen. Interessierst du dich fur Deutschlernen? Bist du bereit fur studieren, lesen, und sprechen in Deutsch? Willst du, in nur 12 Wochen, Deutsch sprechen und verstehen? Dann solltest du GER 101 studieren!This (and much more) can be written comfortably after GER 101. Here's the English translation below:This course was my favorite course at Princeton. Professor Rankin has founded a great course. He has a plan for each day, and you learn a lot of new information every time. I not only learned to read and understand German, but also to speak German and to understand cultural issues. Also ? maybe especially for the pandemic year, but I think for a normal year too ? I was really excited about this course because I talked to a few other students for an hour every day.Are you interested in learning German? Are you ready to study, read, and speak in German? Do you want to speak and understand German in just 12 weeks? Then you should study GER 101!",,
