Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take it, very good intro class",,
Take it--its a great time!,,
"Take this! I've never taken any other language courses at Princeton, but this is so much better than any other language classes i have ever taken. The German department really put in a lot of effort to develop this language sequence.",,
"German 101 is everything you can hope: well-run, fast-paced, quickly graded, and fair to all. The textbook in particular is fantastic. Take German to take advantage of the best language instruction Princeton has to offer",,
"This course is a decent time commitment and can be challenging and overwhelming at times, especially if you're coming into GER101 with no experience in the language (as I did). While I wouldn't recommend taking this a fifth course, I'd strongly recommend the course to anyone who's interested in German language and culture!",,
"Disclaimer, this review is coming from someone who took German in high school so I am coming into this class with some background of the language. I feel like German is a great language to choose for the AB language requirement or even just for fun. The German program at Princeton is great and I felt the teaching style was really helpful in further developing my German language skills. They are decently forgiving when grading tests, I get the impression that they are here to truly help you learn German, not fail you (you have to correct the errors on your tests, forcing you to visibly correct your mistakes). My only big warning is to stay on top of the daily homework. I fell behind a few times and it was a headache to catch up on because it adds up. Also make sure you familiarize yourself with the vocabulary from the homework before coming to each class. The instructors were really there for you, even finding times outside of their office hours to sit down and help you understand the material (grammar) step-by-step.",,
Try to do your homework everyday and review vocabulary regularly.,,
Just do it. Languages are fun and in this course you will make progress faster than you could possibly expect.,,
As long as you do the homework you will love the class,,
"If you want to learn German, go for it and take with Dennis! I have learned so much this semester and have honestly had fun doing it. DDD can be a lot sometimes but it's definitely helpful for preparation for class and simply just learning the language. The class will push you, but that's a good thing!",,
"GER101 was amazing. Aim to have Dennis as your instructor, he is the best teacher I've ever had! The workload isn't insane, and you'll never feel like you're doing busywork. This class gives a great, comprehensive introduction to the German language.",,
Make sure you are interested in learning about colonial religion!,,
enjoy,,
"This is not a bad class, but I don't think the curriculum teaches the German language very well. der-die-das is a major hit-or-miss. Introduction of vocabulary is decent, but the major issue is grammar. The pace that grammar is introduced felt to me rather sluggish. Some of its grammar explanations are useful, but others are simply not broad enough or not very clear. If you want to speak German well and with clean grammar, be sure to look up grammar on the internet on your own and drill it intensively until you have mastered it, because der-die-das will not do it for you.",,
If you're at all interested in German - please try it out. Taught excellently and you'll learn a lot.,,
"German is great! Princeton's German department knows their stuff, so this is a great course to take. The textbook was also written by a Princeton prof, so there are a ton of fun references to things about Princeton in it.",,
This is not an easy language. Be prepared to put in work. And instructors are pretty hit or miss,,
"This is a fantastic course. It is well-taught, and the material is interesting. Provided you stay on top of coursework and participate in class, you will do well, and come away learning far more German than you knew at the course's outset. It is helpful to practice with classmates outside of class, and to practice writing in german on the side. Vocabulary acquisition is at the center of the course, so above all, remaining on top of that is the most important thing.",,
