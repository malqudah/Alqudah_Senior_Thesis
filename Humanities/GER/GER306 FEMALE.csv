Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Professor Nagel is by far one of my favorite professors at Princeton and so student-first that I could never ask for a better teacher. No matter what subject material she teaches, it's always inspiring and she has really helped me grow.",,
"Professor Nagel is brilliant, thoughtful and cares greatly for her students. I found Professor Nagel to approach texts in ways I haven't ever encountered before and found her close attention to affect and rhetoric to push my thinking and how I analyze texts in new directions. Definitely take a course with Professor Nagel if given the chance. The reading assigned for the course is both fascinating and manageable; the highlight of the course were the novels and novellas that we read. The writing work load is on the lighter side in comparison to other German courses I have taken.",,
"Professor Nagel is well-read, passionate, and kind. She's a great teacher in general, and she was great in this course. If you're looking for a stimulating upper-level German course with a thoughtful professor, look no further.",,
