Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"A wonderful course! I had been looking forward to delving deeper into Walter Benjamin's works, and I was not disappointed. Professor Jennings was good at helping us understand fairly dense and complicated readings (which were sometimes unpublished and in fairly rough shape).",,
"If you have a good understanding of European cultural history and the philosophical influences that Benjamin draws on (Nietzsche, Marx, Freud), then I would recommend this class. Knowing German helps too but definitely isn't required. It is sad that Jennings is retiring, so I don't think that the class will be offered again. Just put in a lot of work into your papers and participate in class, I think the grading is very fair.",,
"Michael Jennings was and is an incredible gift to humanity. His aura and his legacy will linger in my mind and my academic brain for a long time, now. I don't know how this course would be run with a different professor, as Jennings is retiring this year, but the texts of Benjamin themselves are worthy of every exploration and detail. They changed my life and way I think and write in subtle and major ways. Even the mere act of studying a singular person's production is at once incredibly historically grounding and personally fascinating-- the fact that Benjamin is a brilliant theoretician, allegorist, Marxist is even better. (oh, and if you're deciding still? Benjamin > Adorno).",,
"Professor Jennings is an absolutely fantastic prof. Walter Benjamin was a very fascinating individual although his writings are NOT for the faint of heart as they are confusing and sometimes seemingly lacking direction, but overall a good mind-bender.",,
"It was a privilege to take this course on Walter Benjamin with one of the most prominent Benjamin scholars of the current day. Thank you Professor Jennings for an excellent seminar and for an introduction into the world of Benjamin. This course was an intellectual highlight of my semester, despite the circumstances of the pandemic, and I am honoured to have been able to have had the chance to be taught by Professor Jennings on Benjamin before his retirement.",,
"If Professor Jennings ever teaches another course on Benjamin, TAKE IT!",,
"I really enjoyed taking this course, even though I had very little background in philosophy. That being said, I think both Prof. Jennings and Walter Benjamin challenged everyone in the course to reevaluate their modes of thinking. Even though I was often left dissatisfied with the answers in the reading material, I thought the course was taught super well.",,
"With Jennings, an incredible class. Pretty sure I was one of the only non-German majors, but it was still interesting and enjoyable. Can't speak to future iterations.",,
