Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
I would not recommend this course to a student looking to get a broad introduction to interdisciplinary design. Understand before taking this class that it is a massive time commitment and you will be working on assignments for this class for more hours than the bulk of your other assignments. I would not recommend taking this class junior or senior year or at any other time when you have semester or year long projects like a JP or Thesis as it is nearly imposible to balance both.  A positive about this class is it is rewarding at the end of the projects because you have to put so much effort into your work .,,
"This class is very different from other Princeton courses, but you will learn a lot. Be prepared for a large time commitment, of at least 7 hours of class time a week, plus working on projects and assignments outside of that time.",,
"As many of the other reviews likely will suggest, this course is an absolute time sink. For anyone interested in architecture (or the urban studies program for that matter), this is a great class. It doesn't matter what major you are, as this class generally welcomes any field of study, but it might be especially good for people looking to be more well-versed in design thinking. Elisa and Lluis are great, and they adapt quickly; the trip to Mexico was cancelled this semester, but they still managed to work with all of the changes.",,
"Take this class! It is a huge time commitment and very intense, but one of the most engaging and rewarding classes I've taken at Princeton. Elisa, Lluis, and Daniel were so invested and helpful throughout the whole course. If you have any interest in architecture or the built environment, I highly reccomend this class - no matter your major!",,
"This is a very time consuming course with a steep learning curve if you have no prior Architecture experience. However, you will be proud of the work you accomplish.",,
