Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Do your work and do it well. Best to start working earlier.,,
Get ready for your feelings to be hurt at pin up. Don't take it personally. Do you best. Show up and work hard.,,
Amazing course! But it is a huge time commitment and you will have to spend a good chunk of time at the architecture building so plan for that. Would not recommend for virtual learning.,,
I would take this course but also know that it is very time consuming!,,
Studio work takes a lot longer than you think. Start early and you'll avoid 3 am Monday nights before pinups!,,
"Studio is definitely a time commitment, but it was the most interesting and most technically rewarding class I took this semester. It was nice to finally have some more hands-on experience in architectural drawing/design, and I appreciated that Professor Brown really holds each student to a high standard/quality of work.",,
Time manage and do not wait until the last minute to complete your design work.,,
