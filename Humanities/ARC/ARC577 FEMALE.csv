Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Excellent class. The weekly response is a lot of work.,,
"If you have the chance, take one of Sylvia's seminars!",,
Don't miss a seminar!,,
The course is a must-take.,,
"Sylvia is the best professor at Princeton SOA in term of both her intellectual engagement and academic generosity. Definitely take her seminars and engage thoroughly with course materials / class participation. I was initially more interested in taking a class with her than the topic itself, but finished the course with a lot of intellectual curiosity on the subject matter (exhibition culture and architecture).",,
Take it and make sure you plan your time accordingly to get all the readings done. Sylvia Lavin is extremely organized and she will require that of you too.,,
"I would highly recommend this course if you have an interest in anything to do with museums, curation, or architecture history.",,
