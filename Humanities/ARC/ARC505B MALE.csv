Please Note,Princeton University does not consider student comment information provided to be official University course evaluation data; it does not take that information into consideration in approving courses for permanent status; and it does not take the information into consideration in making tenure or promotion decisions.,
Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
If you want to take this course because you think you will have great professors who care about you and your project or who have meaningful advice to give then this is not for you. If you want to have contact with people in Europe and want to do a project all by yourself with only negative feedback then go for it.,,
I would recommend the studio to students that are interested in the prompt.,,
"This is a studio which will only work well for a self-motivated, independent student who isn't afaid to chart their own course.",,
"The project in this course was extremely interesting, but difficult. The professors were very good when in attendance, but were not around that often.",,
