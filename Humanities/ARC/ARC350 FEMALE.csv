Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
It takes a bit to get used to Gia but she really pushes you on core conceptual ideas of architecture. Be ready for more abstract projects and lots of trial-and-error.,,
"Don't walk, run.  You will lose every single piece of you you've had left at Princeton.  I fell asleep in my other classes due to exhaustion.  Nothing pleases Gia Wolff unless you were the established favourites with a ton of ARCH experience at the beginning of the class.  She will destroy you, and you will walk away with a ton of stuff for your portfolio and absolutely no improved skills, just how not to cry after you've given your all but was utterly wrecked for it.  You will reconsider Architecture and possibly the entire course of your life, but not in a positive way.  Arch, CivArch majors; bless you, you are headed into war.",,
"Don't take this class. So much work and no matter how much time you put into the exercises, the professor will never appreciate it and never be satisfied.",,
"This is one of the hardest classes I've taken at Princeton. Not because the material itself was difficult, studios are always dependent on what you make on them. But because Gia demanded so much from us. Some make see that as a bad sign, but I've never seen a teacher care so much about her students and their progress. It was a lot of tough love and really difficult nights, but I do think I've come out with stronger architecture and thinking skills.",,
