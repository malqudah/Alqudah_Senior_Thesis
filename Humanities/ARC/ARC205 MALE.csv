Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"TAKE THIS CLASS! I cannot recommend it enough. Mario encourages creativity to the max. Even if you have never been involved in design, he makes sure you are interested ad enjoying your time in the class. Everyone's feedback is amazing and they help you a lot during desk crits. Even though it is time consuming, it makes it all worth it in the end. Listen to what they are suggesting, and always try to improve your assignment. Most importantly: Have fun!",,
Take but be prepared for a lot of work,,
Go ahead and take it if you want to know more about architectural representations. I took the class online and I thought it worked surprisingly well. You have to have a thick skin for getting critiqued but it's all to make you a better architect!,,
This course will definitely challenge you to think in space and to make statements through design.,,
"Expect long hours of work, and ask for help if you need it. Don?t procrastinate!",,
