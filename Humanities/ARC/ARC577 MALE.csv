Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Mirko is incredibly knowledgeable, and brings a unique point of view to the subject. He is incredibly generous with his time and really dives deep to uncover the subject at hand.",,
"take Mirkos class, he is a passionate educator and will spark your interest in what ever topic you are interest in.",,
I think that this course is fun if you are looking for an extra course. I wouldn't compare it to the other theory seminars that are offered at the SoA which are far more rigorous.,,
"Take it! Provides a very useful set of tools for understanding the built world (sociological, curatorial, and historical). Excellent professor!",,
Absolutely take this course,,
"If you have the opportunity, take a class with Mirko.",,
