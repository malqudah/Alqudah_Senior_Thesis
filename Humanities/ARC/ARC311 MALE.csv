Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"A lot of work, but a lot of really cool work.  Ever wanted to learn how to use every tool ever and laser cut and work with robots?  Then this is your class!  McEwen is an amazing professor!",,
"Mitch is fun and understanding. Juan Pablo did an AMAZING job TAing this course, and while you might not have him next year, hopefully your AI is equally as helpful.  The weekly exercises are fun, even if some take longer than others. Many of you have to take this as an architecture major, but I took this to meet my CEE arc requirements. It was well worth it and I wish I had taken it before or during my other studios just because you learn so many cool techniques for making! It also just helps you think about making and design in a different way. My advice would be to always think about how you can do more than what the example exercise does. Be creative! You are in a design course after all! This course really allows you to explore without a semester-long project guiding the whole thing, which makes you feel much more free to create. Find a good partner(s) for the group projects that you work well with.",,
