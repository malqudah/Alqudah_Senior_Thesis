Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This course is interesting in learning about and experimenting with architectural robotic/automatic practices. Stefana is very knowledgeable and cool in general. Sometimes the class was disorganized on zoom and exercises were sent out rather late, but Stefana and Ian made a large effort to be available for students and teach them about various types of fabrication techniques.",,
very chill class that introduces you to useful machine fabrication methods,,
Stefana is super chill! I was so intimidated to take this course but she (and our AI Ian) made grasshopper super accessible. I did minimal work and probably got an A-. Ian was very helpful. You will be in good hands if Ian assists this course again.,,
Take initiative and dedicate time?each person dictates how much they get out of the class based on how involved they choose to be.,,
"Stefana and Ian are fantastic. I highly recommend this course even though as an Arch major you have to take it. It makes you much more comfortable operating laser cutters, 3D printers, and robotic fabrication technologies. I did this course externally (F2020) and Stefana and Ian went above and beyond to accomodate everyone and all the time zones. We even built a wall at Princeton via zoom!",,
"If you're a civarc major trying to decide which arc elective to take, I would highly recommend this one! This course was very well organized and I learned a lot about digital fabrication, 3D printing, robotic fabrication, and more that I don't think I would have gotten out of any CEE course. I think the course would be even better in an in person environment with access to the equipment in the SoA.",,
I feel like I wouldn't take this course if I didn't need to. But Stefana is lovely and Ian was always so willing to help.,,
