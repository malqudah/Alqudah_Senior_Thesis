Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take this course if you want to develop a deeper understanding of music theory! This class covers so many cool ideas, and it really will help you become a better composer/performer/listener of music. The problem sets can definitely be difficult sometimes, but if you took MUS105 you'll be used to this. The larger composition assignments take even more time, so make sure to start them a few days in advance.",,
"This course I definitely meant for those who are very musically inclined. It is a difficult course, but you learn a lot. I really enjoyed it.",,
"Juri is the GOAT. 106 moves really quickly and takes a lot of time, but it's worth it. We moved out of tonality halfway through the course, which was really interesting and made it very different from 105. It's definitely a challenge, and you may sometimes feel like everyone else is a prodigy while you're just out there trying your best, but keep at it. You will be surprised at what you accomplish, especially in terms of your compositional abilities.",,
"I mean it's pretty much just 105 continued. You'll learn a lot, but it's not easy by any means.",,
Take with Juri. She is amazing. go to office hours and she will explain everything so well. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I have a lot of theory background and I can honestly say I would not have a good grade without talking in person to juri. she's the best. course is fun and you learn a lot about theory. I can compose now! super cool:),,
Big fan. You will learn a ton and learn to appreciate new styles of music.,,
"The projects are the most enjoyable aspect of this course. Juri is a great lecturer. The psets seem like busy work. For ear training, you are at an extreme advantage if you have perfect pitch.",,
"Fun class! Harder than 105, but you get to do way more experimental stuff and break most of the rules you learned. Set aside some extra time for the psets so you can ask about things in office hours.",,
Juri is awesome and she has cool sweaters. This course is a little boring if you are a more experienced musician but if you're someone who wants to learn the foundations of Western classical theory this is a great overview. Reasonable amounts of work. Lots of class time but what are you gonna do.,,
"Ask your preceptors questions, work hard. Have a lot of familiarity with playing a melodic instrument or else dont even bother taking it. VERY HARD class with a ton of work and not taught well/clearly. Generally a very stressful course.",,
"This is a great class to take if you're interested in Romantic and post-Romantic harmony. It picks up about where MUS 105 (and AP Theory) leave off. By the end of this 105/106 sequence you will have an excellent foundation in the theory behind most music composed from 1650 to 1950. Also, Juri is great! Definitely one of the better professors who regularly teach this course.",,
"You should take this course with Juri! She is sweet and hilarious. She also teaches you an impressive range of material. The lectures sometimes move a bit too quickly, but she posts the slides after each lecture, and the preceptors are there to help you if you're confused. If you took MUS 105, you will know that this course is a big drain on your time. There were fewer assignments than in 105, but there was a midterm and two big compositions, so beware - it may be tricky. But it's a great way to cement the skills you learn in 105, learn new skills, and get better at composition. You have a lot of freedom with the final project, and it's very satisfying.",,
"Definitely take this course if you're interested in music and want to strengthen your theory background. It's not easy and the assignments are time consuming, but you'll learn a lot! (also, Juri is wonderful)",,
Juri is amazing. such a great engaging and funny lecturer. The content is tough but solid and you will learn a ton.,,
"Highly recommend. The first half is a continuation of the first semester (Classical era composition/analysis) with more complex topics like augmented sixth chords, descending fifth progressions, and creating more interesting harmonic progressions, while the second half is essentially a survey course of modern classical music, jazz harmony, and extended techniques/tunings, etc. Assignments get a little bit easier and more interesting in this course and lectures are generally pretty interesting as well, but you have to be pretty invested in the material to get the most out of it. Juri is really knowledgeable about all of the material and hilarious, so try to get her as your preceptor if she's teaching.",,
MUS106 is a very different beast from MUS105. The greater focus on modern composition techniques makes this feel much less structured and more creatively free than 105. I think if you enjoyed 105 you will also enjoy 106.,,
"This class is a lot of work, and the assignments take a deceptively long amount of time. It will be hard to earn an A in this class.",,
"Only take if you absolutely have to. The lectures are confusing and the psets frustrating. Once you get to serialism and 12-tone equal temperament, all bets are off if you understand it.",,
"This was a great course, and I enjoyed it more than mus 105 because the topics are more interesting and there is more of an emphasis on creativity. Juri is a wonderful person and brilliant lecturer, and John is a really good preceptor.",,
"Use the precepts to ask questions. Failing that, go to office hours to ask questions and have an expert look at your music.",,
"I think this class is better than MUS105, as it goes over a lot more practical music theory. Even if you don't have to take it, if you took 105 I think you should continue and take this course.  Also, Juri is a great lecturer.",,
"This is a great course if you are interested in learning more about music theory, both classical and modern. The course is taught very well and help is easily accessible too. Definitely take this course if you want to get better at ear training too. The ear training precepts did wonders for me and I feel like I hear music in a new light now.",,
"Juri is a very good lecturer! Get her precept and GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. Seriously, she will help you with your homework/compositions immensely and point out any mistakes you may have before you turn in the homework. Do not take this class in a five-class semester, though... workload is pretty difficult, even if you are familiar with music theory.",,
