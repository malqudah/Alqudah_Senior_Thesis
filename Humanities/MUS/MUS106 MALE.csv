Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Go to lecture and do the assignments early because they can take quite some time. Ear training focuses on atonal music, so if that is something new to you, the preparation required for those precepts may be somewhat significant. It's an interesting course with interesting material.",,
"This was an amazing course!!! I'm so glad I took it after 105, especially because Donnacha is an amazing professor. He is truly amazing: I would take any class with him. It wasn't too hard either, about the same difficulty as 105",,
"Take this course for a fascinating foray into the world of Western music where the workload is very, very reasonable. There's a lot of class --- 2 precepts a week plus ear training on Fridays, but the homework is so negligible that that doesn't matter. It's a good class; you'll learn a lot. The composition assignments are very fun, besides.",,
"Take it! Phenomenal course for those interested in music composition and/or theory. Don't be put off if you didn't enjoy MUS 105: the work in this course is much more composition-driven, and the analysis that IS done is much different from the Baroque counterpoint of 105. I feel as though I left this course with a much stronger understanding and appreciation of composed music, as well as useful ear training skills.",,
"What a great course! Professor Dennehy is hilarious, the preceptors are all great, and I loved having a class where I could be creative and study what I love outside of my major.",,
"One of the best courses I've taken. If you enjoyed MUS105, you will probably enjoy this course as well. The coursework is a tad heavier than in MUS105, but offers a deal more creative freedom as well which is quite enjoyable.",,
"I would recommend it as a followup to 105, would be hard if you haven't either done 105 or have a very solid music theory background. I found it slightly less fun than 105, since some of the more avant-gsrde modern music we listened to was harder to appreciate, but it was still a good class. Daniel was a very good preceptor.",,
"I enjoyed this course more than MUS105, especially when voice leading and functional harmony started to fall away. I liked stepping outside the baroque and early classical realm into modality, minimalism, and atonal serialist music a lot, but for people who like classical music, the first six weeks of the course stayed within the realm of functional harmony with a focus on lieder and sonata form. It was a good overview of Western music over the last few hundred years.",,
"Study the lecture slides because they will help you immensely on homework and exams. Make sure to practice sight reading throughout the week as some of the exercises can be pretty tricky. And finally, be open with your preceptors because they are very helpful and considerate people.",,
Definitely take this class! You will learn so much and be inspired by the material discussed.,,
"MUS106 is essentially the same format as MUS105, so if you enjoyed the fall semester you will probably have a great time with this course! Start your compositions early; be sure to ask questions in precept if you have them; take notes on the lecture slides if they're available before class. It helps to have access to a keyboard for the psets, but the assignments are doable without one. This course taught me a lot and helped me become a better musician (especially the ear training classes), and if I enjoyed it in an online format, I'm sure it will be an even better experience in person!",,
Excellent course! The instructors are all amazing and the material is very interesting. The assignments are more composition heavy so plan your time out accordingly because they take a fair amount of time to finish. GO TO LECTURE and don't be afraid to ask instructors for help outside of class. I definitely struggled a lot with the material but I was always able to get help and eventually I was able to understand the core concepts.,,
"Take it! If you liked MUS105 (or another music theory course), you'll probably like this too. This class lets you explore a variety of musical topics, and it is interesting to see how different ideas can work together. I feel like I was able to gain a new appreciation of the music I like and other types of music as well. The composition assignments are much more open-ended than in MUS105, and you really get to develop your own musical voice. The workload is not overwhelming, and it is manageable as a fifth class. If you have any interest in music or music theory, I would say take it. And if you can, get Daniel Silliman as a preceptor, he's great.",,
"Take the class! It's a very similar style to 105. Professor Dennehy and the preceptors are all wonderful. The class is engaging even if you already know a lot about music theory, but it's also paced well and structured so that you should be fine even if you aren't super comfortable with it.",,
"If you have questions, ask them, because the preceptors want to help you.",,
"Highly recommend this course to anybody interested in music. Although it's more difficult than most other music dept. offerings, you'll learn a great deal, and Prof. Dennehy is both understanding and intelligent. (Also responsive.)",,
