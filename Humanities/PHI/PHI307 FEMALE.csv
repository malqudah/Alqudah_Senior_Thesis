Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Super interesting and accessible ethics class. You don't need to do the readings to succeed, Prof. McGrath does a great job explaining them in lecture.",,
"This class was among the best I have taken here. Professor McGrath did a wonderful job creating the syllabus to walk us through some of the leading schools of thought on moral philosophy. The readings were fascinating, and the lectures did a fantastic job clarifying the reading and setting it in context with all the other readings throughout the course. Professor McGrath was also very good at encouraging interesting and diverse discussions, by drawing out different perspectives and arguments from everyone in the class, including more reserved students. Studying under professor McGrath is a joy. She brings positive energy to everything. From in class interactions to her feedback on assignments, she is always insightful, positive and encouraging. Really enjoyed this class. Highly recommend.",,
"Definitely harder than other SPIA distribution fulfilling requirements. I really liked the professor though, she was very kind, knowledgable, and well-spoken. I just wish the class didn't get derailed by students with tangential points.",,
Professor McGrath's lectures are some of the best I've had at Princeton. She is one of the kindest and brightest teachers our university has! Cannot recommend this course enough.,,
"As a SPIA major I took this for the ethics requirement, and I thought it was good! Just make sure you don't underestimate the amount of content that you'll need to know for the final",,
Definitely take it and do all of the readings each week!,,
"I think if you are taking this for a departmental distribution, it's best to go during office hours or speak with the professor or preceptor. Professor McGrath is really nice and understanding, but lectures can be harder to catch up with because they might go further from your background in philosophy.",,
"Highly recommended, especially for philosophy majors",,
The best philosophy course I have taken at Princeton. (I have taken 12 in total).,,
