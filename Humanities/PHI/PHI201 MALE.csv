Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"If you are considering taking this course, I would recommend it if you are curious about logic. It is not necessary to have a background in this topic and, where it may be more difficult in the beginning, you will find yourself comfortable with logic and some of its nuances if you finish this course. However, don't take this course if you think it will be easy as it does take a real commitment since you will be doing a lot of practice problems for exams but it will not overburden you if you pace yourself.",,
"Sam is a great professor, the material is hard but she makes it much better.",,
"Honestly thought this would be interesting for a COS major, and ended up being mind numbingly bored by the professor?s pointless pedantry predilection. At least the psets were relatively quick.",,
Sometimes confusing but interesting stuff!,,
"Definitely recommend this course if you're a BSE major looking to fill a humanities requirement, or if you're interested in logic in general. Sam is an amazing professor- super nerdy, but in the best way possible. Her lectures are extremely engaging, and you can tell that she really cares about her students and wants everyone to succeed. This is a great introduction course to the topic!",,

"Super interesting course, and not too hard particularly if you're a STEM major. Sam is a great instructor who cares a ton about her students--after we got sent home, she went way above and beyond to make sure that everyone was doing okay and had all the help they'd need with the course. Would definitely recommend!",,
"Not the easy A I thought because they were very picky about the grading for the conceptual short answer questions. Also, sometimes preceptors would say different things (which mattered for grading) which was confusing and came off as disorganized. But it was overall not too difficult. Psets were pass fail which was a life saver. I recommend this class if it sounds interesting to you, but it does get pretty dry and to be honest I don't see the use of learning this kind of material (unless you're doing math or want to take more logic classes). I wish I had taken a more interesting, easier, essay-based humanities class instead of this. Not really worth it in my opinion. - a BSE sophomore",,
It's a great class it you are interested in the subject matter.,,
"Take this course. The whole team is amazing. It's not a work-heavy course, nor is it extremely complicated. It does start out very basic and then ends up going really quickly through topics, but it's a lot of fun. I think it requires the right level of critical thinking, helping you train that philosophical muscle and use it in other classes.",,
It's a good class to learn logic and Sam cares a lot.,,
pretty easy class,,
"The preceptors, Ian and Haley, are excellent. Use them!",,
"If you are at all interested in logic, take this course! It's definitely not what you would expect and although it starts off as kind of an interesting ""logic puzzle""-esque class, you will begin learning about deeper and more mysterious conceptual topics as the class goes. If Sam is teaching the course, I HIGHLY recommend taking it. She is an amazing lecturer and person and will do her best to make sure you succeed, as will the preceptors. Overall, a great course to take as a distribution requirement for BSE, not too stressful but still challenging enough to be interesting.",,
"tough course. coming in, I thought it was going to be easy. entire grade was based on exams, which made it quite stressful for me. however, the class did enlighten logical thinking in me, and i think it is an important area to understand.Sam and the TAs were quite helpful, and Sam was understanding after moving virtually.",,
"PHI 201 was great! Sam (the professor) is really great as a preceptor. She's super helpful at explaining the material and is available for additional questions you have. I took PHI 201 as my EC as a COS BSE major, and I think that it was really interesting.Virtual Learning: Lectures became modules, which had pre-recorded lectures, participation quizzes, and occasional readings. Precepts became optional and were live over Zoom. I thought the course was well adapted to virtual learning, even though it was not idea.",,
"Very easy for anyone who has even the slightest experience in proof-based math, especially seniors looking for an easy class. Just be advised the workload is decently sized.",,
Very relaxing course for senior spring.,,
"This course is a good way to get your EC done. It is not too difficult comparatively speaking, especially to people in math or science majors since a lot of the problem solving feels similar to a math problem, but it is still quite thought provoking and interesting.",,
"This was a fun class! The psets were a bit time consuming, and the class structure with 4 exams got a bit exhausting. But Prof. Berstler was so excited to teach that it was easy to care. Not super tough, and interesting enough to keep you engaged.",,
"Definitely take this course! Especially if Sam Berstler is the Prof! She's great and really makes the content super easy to understand. I know in the past this class has been difficult for people who don't enjoy math, but I'm a hardcore humanities person and had no trouble understanding everything.",,
Go to office hours if you are struggling and ask for help. All the teachers are helpful and willing to guide you.,,
Super fun class for all years and all majors. All the staff is so helpful and wants to be there for you throughout the course.,,
This was an interesting class that was well-supported and quite manageable.,,
"Definitely take this course! It's pretty intuitive up until maybe the last couple of weeks, and if you're a math major/have experience with proofs it'll be a lot easier for you. The first few weeks are very very easy (truth tables and such), so if you're thinking about dropping during add/drop realize that it gets much harder once you get into predicate, translations, and all the conceptual problems.",,
"Despite the difficult circumstances we faced this semester, Sam and her staff really pulled through and tried their hardest to give us the best support they could while maintaining the quality of teaching. Sam really showed how much she cared about her students and tried really hard to keep everyone engaged and on track over online instruction. Major props to her (and Ian, who is the best preceptor). I came into this class somewhat prepared to do logic-type math and thinking (with some previous background) so it was never that hard, and there were definitely students who were way more prepared for this class than me. That makes it kind of hard to be in the portion of the class who do not know any logic, so if you're in that boat, be prepared to feel like you're struggling for a bit while everyone else knows the material. But I do think it's not a lost cause at all; succeeding in this class is really doable if you put in the work to learn the small basic things and work your way up from there. Would highly recommend taking if you are interested in logic at all, especially with Sam!",,
sam is a great lecturer and the way she adapted to online classes was amazing. I wish lectures weren't mandatory lol because I don't think the first half of the class was that necessary but god times pretty easy a too,,
Go to lecture and precept and do the problem sets as they are very similar to the material on the exams. Small workload if you skim the readings.,,
Professor Berstler definitely made the material very engaging and accessible.,,
Take this course. Excellent professor and workload wasn't too strenuous.,,
