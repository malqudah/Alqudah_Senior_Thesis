Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Make sure to review the lecture slides, because the exams become more challenging as the go along.",,
Easy 5th. More of a linguistics or philosophy of language course than logical prep for 340 or 312. Textbook is 10/10 and lectures are SLOW. Exams were quite easy. Recommend ? very interesting content and fairly intuitive.,,
"Took it freshman spring as a fifth with my bse reqs. Basically no work other than cramming a couple hours before tests. Highly recommend as a pdf class because 100% of your grade comes from tests. Might be a little stressful otherwise because you can get a lot of points off for being careless on tests, but it's manageable.",,
Class is well taught and made me feel like I was learning. The only thing is I don't know where or how I would apply the content to daily life.,,
"I'd recommend to choose whether you'll self-study through the book or you'll want to attend lectures to learn the content, they both will get you just as far. Make sure to understand logical statements at the first exam mark and  you'll find this course simple for the rest of the semester.",,
Don't get baited like me. Really easy at first but they will take off large points for the smallest details. A good pdf though.,,
"If taught by Professor Stojnic, only take it because it's a free A. Exams are easy if you prepare for them. Besides that, the course is horribly organized and taught.",,
"I am a humanities major, and mostly this course was comprised of stem people. I did well at first so I decided not to pdf, but I ended up doing really poorly on the third test, which covers a more complex concept to grasp than the first two tests did. This obliterated my grade for the course because it was worth 25%, and there is no way to remedy poor grades because it is all tests. The final test also exclusively covers the final topic of the course rather than being comprehensive. So don't be fooled by the relative ease of the course at first.",,
This course was different from what I expected-- we mostly only did translations of statements which seemed meaningless. But it is good if you want a light workload.,,
"For this class, there were no problem sets assigned. The only work was to do the readings for the week but even those were almost optional as the lecturer always went over the material covered in the textbook. This class is very manageable even if you miss lectures, as the textbook is a great supplementary material.",,
Very straightforward course,,
"Take this as an easy fifth if you're in any way interested in logic! Everything is very formulated, and you can do well just by doing practice problems in the book! The only assignments were 4 exams which were like 10 problems each but super manageable.",,
"Do the readings and exercises in the textbook for the course, they're very helpful and will make it easier to understand how to do the exams.",,
It was an easy and fun course.,,
Do the readings and pay extra attention in precepts.,,
The course content is quite basic and the course has an extremely low workload. Excellent class for a distribution requirement. Bear in mind though that the entire grade was based on four exams -- three of which are concentrated in the second half of the semester.,,
"This course definitely ramps up AFTER the PDF deadline, so be careful. You will either have to be dedicated to doing all the readings or going to all the lectures (but don't really need both imo). Overall pretty interesting, and a pretty good fifth class.",,
You want a pset class. Trust me. I took it without psets and every little mistake took off so many points on the exams.,,
"Pretty easy course if you put a minimal amount of effort in, but not intellectually stimulating.",,
"No need to put much effort, but a fair amount is needed to get an A. If you really cannot find any other easy 5th class, I'd choose this as the last resort.",,
"Be careful when deciding whether to take this course with Stojnic as a professor. The lectures are basically going though a slideshow with no direct student interaction, so you're pretty much expected to read the textbook on your own if you're confused. Precepts are helpful, and they help to fill in the gaps and prepare you for exams, but they're only 50 minutes a week so you'll still need to put the work in to review harder problems yourself. The course material is interesting and not too difficult for an EC, but if you don't care about analyzing what makes certain logical arguments work and others not work, you probably won't find this course enjoyable.",,
"Grade is based on only four exams, so prep a lot for those.",,
Good class to add as a fifth or sixth if you are looking to fulfill some distribution reqs.,,
go to lecture and you'll be completely set for the entire course. really interesting material and probably the least work i've done for a class at princeton,,
"Not hard but easy to mess up on tests (esp if you don't go to class). Half of the material is translating english into logic symbols which is particularly annoying and subjective, but otherwise this is similar to a math class. Eh",,
"The course material for logic is interesting and has many useful applications. Unfortunately, the course is structured in a way that makes this content hard to learn and hard to appreciate. The most important thing to know about this course is that 100% of your grade is from the four exams you take. If you're diligent about studying, you can easily get full scores on all of these exams and cruise through the class. Unfortunately, the exams are very unforgiving ? get a single problem wrong on a single exam and you can literally drop down an entire letter grade (there's no partial credit). Lectures are useless ? about two pages of textbook reading are covered per 50 minute lecture, and the professor is ineffective at teaching. Also, pre-midterm, you can literally self-study all the material covered in a single hour. (COS 126 covers about the same half semester's worth of Boolean logic in a single lecture.)Should you take this course? Honestly, it's hard to say. It's technically an easy fifth, so long as you don't screw up the exams, but it's not very enjoyable, thanks to the poor quality of lectures and the textbook. (For context, I took this with Stojnic.)",,
Keep up with the readings and lecture is not always the best way to learn the content from this class but it is helpful to clarify parts of the readings.,,
This course is amazing. Not too much work. Very fair grading and material is easy to understand. 100000% recommend taking it!!,,
Not bad to take as your distribution. Beware: first third of the course is much easier than the second and third. Go to precept if you need help doing practice problems before exams.,,
"Absolute dumpster of a class. This should be a completely trivial EC if you've taken *any* STEM class before, and if you've taken any marginally ""advanced"" STEM class, like MAT215 and/or COS340, you literally do not have to show up to a single lecture or do any of the readings. Just go to precept and do the practice tests before each of the three exams, and you should be more than fine. The content, however, is *incredibly* boring. I have never been less engaged with a class here, and literally could not stand being inside the lecture hall because lectures were so incredibly dull. If you have any nontrivial experience with math or computer science, take this class if you need an EC that you literally don't need to spend more than an hour a week (going to precept) on. Otherwise, take a class where you'll actually learn something.",,
EZ Distribution requirement,,
"Good course for an EC credit if you're COS or another BSE major. Content becomes much complex after the midterm, but generally still manageable.",,
"If you're a (prospective) philosophy major, the content of this course is important, so you should take it. It's not particularly difficult, especially if it's assessed using occasional exams rather than psets - there was very little work from week to week. I will say that the lectures were not particularly exciting or engaging. But Una is very kind and made sure that we learned the material. The only problem was that lectures were slowed down by people asking lots of questions, and that there were often technological glitches.",,
N/A,,
mickey mouse set theory pretty much. skim lecture slides an hour before the exam and you get an A.,,
"Do the practice exams, pay attention in precept.",,
"take it when it's taught with problem sets. otherwise you're just going into exams blind and that determines your entire grade. if andrea is a preceptor, try to get her. lectures are dumb",,
"I would take this class if you need a low workload 5th class. Its not the easiest, because a lot of the learning has to be done by yourself, because it is easy to get distracted and not utilize lecture. I would only take this class if you need a low workload class.",,
"This course has essentially no workload outside of the exams, but that is the danger, since your entire grade is based on exams. It also felt a little disorganized at times, but the fact that there were no psets made it fine.",,
"The workload was really light (we didn't have any readings or psets, so basically you only need to study before exams). Personally the course material wasn't that intellectually challenging and the lectures were a bit dull at times. However overall I think it's an easy fifth class to take and also an easy EC requirement.",,
"Don?t take this course. If you do, don?t show up to lecture and just read the textbook. Maybe go to precept if you have a good preceptor.",,
"A good distribution requirement/fifth class. Definitely go to lecture and precept, but precept is where you learn the most. The exams are very fair; just make sure to do practice questions from the textbook.",,
"Prof. Stojnic is a solid lecturer. She explains the material well and is quite good at answering questions in lecture. Even when you think she might've misunderstood your question, she almost always loops around to answering it. Note that 85% of your grade is from timed exams.",,
pretty good class,,
"Fantastic course if taught by Una Stojnic. The start is very slow, but it picks up momentum near the end. Be sure to attend precept as your ""study time"" for this class -- you likely won't need to study anything beyond that. I wish they covered more things overall, but it's indeed a great EC especially for STEM majors.",,
"Easy course to take if you're already familiar with logic (recommend to math majors). When Prof. Stojnic taught it, there were only exams - which made this a very light course. Things only begin to get a little tricky at around Exam 3 and then at the final. The final exam is not conceptually difficult, just partly tedious.The big takeaway from this course are truth trees, which is basically a systematic way to prove (the validity of) simple arguments by contradiction or disprove them via counter-example. Would recommend. Shoutout to Qichen for being an awesome preceptor.",,
i mean this class sucked but prof stojnic taught straight out of the textbook so you never had any homework whatsoever and were fine for the exams after reading the textbook for one hour,,
"Good 5th class. The first exam is collaborative and basically like a pset. The rest of the exams aren't that bad if you do enough practice. Precepts help too to get comfortable with the material, so I'd recommend attending those. The lectures closely follow the textbook, so you could honestly suffice by reading it (and going to precept) instead of going to lecture if you want.",,
"Attend all lectures and precepts, and you will get the most out of this course. You'll get to think more logically and begin to understand what you are saying (and not saying) in your arguments.",,
"Easy 5th class for a BSE mindset, and useful to learn how to symbolize and validate arguments.",,
"If una is teaching again, don?t take. She Copy paste her slides from a textbook. The class is a joke with no psets, no exam Prep, minimal understanding of how the class works, and poor lecture quality. Avoid when STOJNIC teaches. Also second half of course much harder than first",,
"The content is fairly easy and moves slowly, especially if you are familiar with logical ideas already. The tricky content got covered in precept, and the exams were slightly more difficult than I expected but still not that hard.",,
"Interesting distribution requirement, very easy for math majors",,
"A good, interesting course.",,
"This is an excellent 5th class. Only 4 exams throughout the semester. There are readings, but the lecture covers all the materials needed. When you have to study, it shouldn't take that long. Do practice problems and you'll be fine.",,
"I'd say the class is a fairly easy A/definitely easy pdf class (took it as a 5th). Wasn't really sure what to expect going in since a new professor restructured the course but the first test was take-home and open note/collaborative (basically a pset), and the other in class exams were pretty straightforward if you knew the material and did some textbook review/the practice exam. Not sure how much I actually learned about logic... Each test basically consisted of truth trees and representing sentences in different logic systems so I'm not sure what  exactly I was supposed to take out of the class.",,
"If you are looking for an extremely easy course, this is for you. It has no psets, readings, or essays, and the tests are not bad at all. It is possible to get an A in this course with a <3 hour/week time commitment.",,
This is a fairly straightforward and not terribly difficult course. Take it! Use the textbook for extra practice problems and do the practice tests! Cosim is a great preceptor,,
Textbook helps!,,
This course was easy and only has exams so minimal work. But definitely study the rules and do practice problems to do well on exams.,,
"If you're looking for an EC, this course is one of the easier options. It starts off very easy, but everything builds on previous material and it can be confusing at the end.",,
You can probably teach yourself the course with the textbook. That being said you could similarly learn the course entirely from going to lectures and doing minimal review a few days before exams. The course is only as difficult as you make it but all the material directly builds on top of itself so don't fall behind.,,
This is a good course to fulfill the EC requirement. Interesting material and well-structured.,,
"If you are interested in logic, even if you aren't quite sure what it is, as I was, I would suggest taking this course. They present the material in a very accessible way and I had a great time in this class.",,
"While the content of this class and the exams themselves were not particularly difficult, the course was incredibly unenjoyable due to its structure and the instructors. Firstly, the lectures were poorly prepared. We would often cover two pages worth of content from the textbook and the slides would be word-for-word copies of the textbook. The textbook itself had many errors and confusing explanations, and because it uses logic symbols that are slightly different to other notations, if you find yourself stuck, there's really no external resource that can help you. Ultimately, you are left to pick between the lesser of two evils: go to lecture and cover minimal content at a super slow pace, or try and navigate the chaos which is the textbook. Secondly, your grade is made up of only 4 exams. While the questions are not difficult, the grading is unforgiving. Get one question wrong and that could put you in a position to drop an entire letter grade for the semester. The preparation was also inadequate --- answer keys were often released a day before the exam and the practice final was released less than 24 hours before the final. Thirdly, the precepts felt chaotic and unplanned. Really, there was no place to find clarity in this course.Overall, the course is not that hard if you get everything right. Honestly, it didn't require too much work but it is just a huge gamble for you. If you want to play Russian Roulette with your GPA, then go for it.For reference I took this course with Una.",,
"For any STEM oriented people looking for an EC, this is a solid choice. The material is pretty interesting, albeit you probably won't use this level of logic in other classes. My year our grades only came from exams, which is a bit scary I admit, but just attend class and precept, do the practice exams, and you'll understand the material.",,
"This course is a great 5th?almost no work (no psets, only 3 quizzes plus the final). The content is logic, so basically a math class, and is quite intuitive until about halfway through the semester. Do practice problems in the textbook if you're confused (answers are in the back, it took me too long to realize that) but otherwise you should be fine. Lectures (at least this year) were not very useful.",,
"Go to lecture just so you don?t fall behind, although it may or may not be actually helpful. Then go to precept to reinforce your understanding. If you need a more intuitive in depth understanding, read the textbook. Everything in this course is super straightforward: you know what the exam will always test you on and do practice translations and trees straight out of the textbook to prepare, since the exam is always in the same format. This class is a super easy 5th BSE class for anyone looking to put little effort into a fifth class.",,
"If you attend lectures and precepts, this course is relatively easy and you don't need to spend much time on it.",,
"You should definitely take this class for an EC, especially if you're an AB Cos major. That being said, it is not a blowoff class, even if people don't attend lecture. If you spend the attention to pay attention in lecture and if you go to precept, you will understand the material really well, and you will do well on the exams. DO NOT leave studying to the night before and do not try to learn 5 chapters worth of material in one night.",,
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,,
I really liked it! Literally taught myself the whole course with the textbook. If you follow the textbook religiously you'll do really well! Interesting topic if you're a logical/maths-y person. Very formulaic.,,
"I would say to make sure to keep up with the readings, as they are far more important than the lectures.",,
"If you take it with Prof. Stojinic, she will just turn the textbook into a powerpoint. However, the lectures are very clear and easy to follow. Be warned, though, that your grade depends WHOLLY on your exam scores.",,
The material wasn't really what I expected. Make sure you understand what symbolic logic is before taking this course so you know what you'll be studying,,
"Everything about this course was organized poorly. From the prof showing up late and having her laptop die 10 minutes into lecture, to the impossible to read handwriting for examples, to the poor explanations of concepts. I also got a different grade than my friend for the exact same work on a collaborative exam so grading could definitely be made more consistent too. That being said this course is an easy A and if you have a good preceptor you'll learn everything you need to know. I honestly feel like if the course was better organized, you could learn everything you learn in the semester in half the time.",,
"I love logic but this class was not it. We only did translations and truth trees, which is the boring and not even most important part of logic. The pacing of the class was bad.",,
