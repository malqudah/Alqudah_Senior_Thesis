Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Professor Smith (and Elliot) are great. I was interested in the subject matter to begin with so that definitely helped, but I think this is a great philosophy class for anyone who wants to gain a more fundamental understanding of moral philosophy.",,
I think you really get out of the course what you put into it. Professor Smith and Elliot are super knowledgeable about the material covered and very engaging. Sometimes the material is dry so you should make sure you have interest or passion in the material before taking the class.,,
Take if you are actually interested in systematic ethics!!,,
do the readings bc theyre interesting and theyre like the only work you have to do for this class besides papers,,
"This is a course on metaethics?on what we mean, in terms of philosophical analysis, when we say moral words like ""good"" or ""right."" The assignment format?3 papers?is ideal.",,
"It's a class on metaethics (i.e. about how we determine ethical standards). It would probably make a good complement to standard normative/practical ethics courses. Smith provides comprehensive handouts that make learning a lot easier and completely sum up the lectures. Challenging for someone who hasn't done philosophy before, but probably not impossible. Very fairly graded, so no complaints here. Class was PDF only during this semester due to circumstances, but getting a good grade is definitely achieveable for anyone.",,
"This was probably one of the better philosophy classes to take for the Woody Woo core courses, but be ready to put in a lot of work.",,
"As a philosophy major, this is likely one of the more difficult philosophy classes I've taken at Princeton in terms of getting a grasp of the material. However, Professor Smith is more than helpful in making sure that you understand the readings, and he is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. Overall workload is pretty manageable, and the course is well structured to get a better understanding of the ongoing conversations within metaethics.",,
Take this course if you're interested in metaethics and don't want too much work!,,
