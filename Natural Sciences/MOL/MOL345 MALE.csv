Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"I wouldn't take this course if you don't need to unless you're very interested in the subject. Professor Hughson is a great lecturer and the material is interesting, but the class is a lot of work. It's a lot to keep up with, so I wouldn't add it onto your schedule unless you have to, or are confident in your abilities to manage consistent hours of daily reading and studying for the course.",,
do all the practice problems,,
It was an interesting class! Very engaging,,
"Definitely can be a hard class, but is also v interesting and is organized REALLY well so try to take advantage of all the lecture notes / readings / pset questions they give you if you have trouble in this class. If you take 345 seriously enough, you can definitely succeed -- try to study for the exams well in advance, and go to office hours if you ever have trouble or don't get some concepts. Biochem can definitely be really cool at times, and getting through this course is v satisfying since it gives you a super comprehensive view on human metabolism.",,
"Overall, I thought that this was an ok course. It is hard, but with good time management and focus, it is very doable.",,
Focus on understanding how key concepts connect!,,
Professor Hughson is wonderful,,
Highly recommend!,,
"A tough course, but you learn some really cool stuff! One heads up- the course picks up very quickly after the first test and you cover 8-10 different pathways that all connected in some way. I just wish someone had better explained the big picture to me at the beginning.",,
"Definitely try to study as you go. And do what works best for you, there's a lot of encouragement to read along in the book but I actually found the textbook not so helpful. Do practice problems when you can, and try to always understand the broader picture, especially when you get to metabolism.",,
"If Hughson is teaching this course, you should be good so as long as you pay attention in lecture and study what he gives you in precepts and practice tests. Textbook can supplement if you feel unclear on something.",,
"Take it if Hughson teaches. But, be aware that his wording on the exam is not so good.",,
"Most likely you're taking this course because you have to, but this course is honestly really well done and super interesting!! Take it with Prof. Hughson if you can, he's great. Try and read or at least skim the textbook as you go because they are super helpful. Study for the exams like you did for orgo (at least a week before) and definitely do the practice exams. Finally, definitely always review your notes from the lecture before for the iClickers. Good luck!",,
"Don't take it unless you need to, but if you need to you will be just fine.",,
"Professor Hughson is one of the best professors I've had at Princeton. He truly understands everything he teaches and lays out all the information clearly. He's also really kind and sometimes tells little jokes during lectures. If Hughson is teaching, definitely go to OH if you can! However, just know that this class is a lot of content. All 50 minutes of every lecture are filled with information, and there are daily clicker questions at the beginning of class/throughout lecture (and they're graded for correctness). You NEED to take good notes, and missing class is really difficult. Hughson's notes are helpful, but it can be hard to catch up on a topic if you miss class. You can get away with not reading the textbook, but reading chapter summaries at least is really helpful. Stay organized and keep a format throughout the semester for notes for enzymes/mechanisms/pathways.",,
"Though this course is interesting, it's hard, and you'll be competing with other prehealth students jockeying for high GPAs. For the casual biochemist simply looking for an interesting science class, this is likely not the move, as the competition can often feel more stressful than the actual material. Clicker questions are also a bit of a pain, but you'll learn to appreciate them.",,
"I would advise students to spend a lot of time learning the material along the way and not to fall behind. There is way too much material packed into this class, and it is essentially a test of memorization. Do your best to memorize the material as you go and to use preceptors/friends as resources if your'e ever confused. Good luck!",,
"Definitely take this with Prof. Hughson. His lectures are super good - really concise and easy to understand. His energy just makes class way more enjoyable, and the way he moves through the material is logical. Exams are fair and the clicker quizzes are chill don't get worried about those at all.",,
"Professor Hughson is very entertaining and funny, but there is a LOT of material to memorize and study. You will need to dedicate a lot of time to memorize every detail that has been presented to you in order to do well in this course.",,
Keep up with the memorization throughout the semester,,
"READ THE BOOK and review for the clickers at each lecture. Overall, this is a memorization heavy course so the more time you put into the course the more you will get out of it.",,
Hughson is fantastic. You will enjoy connecting all the dots at the end of the semester. Definitely more enjoyable if you've done reaction kinetics in the past.,,
"Most people in this class have to take it but I would say that if you are going to try it out be ready to be pretty confused/frustrated on the exams, especially the final. Hughson likes to draw from the most minute details in lecture and keep coming back to old stuff (our final was more first semester topics than second semester in my opinion). PSETs are completion, everything else is fine I guess. You'll just have to be ready to grind.",,
"This class is definetly challenging, but so rewarding. I feel like I learned so much and took a ton out of it. Read the textbook for sure- it was so helpful! Professor Hughson though is the star of the show. He's an incredible teacher, and his passion is infectious. Plus his jokes are top notch. I really loved this class",,
"Hughson is a very solid lecturer. Go to lecture to learn (and because iClickers count toward your grade), and try to leave at least a week to review the lecture notes and practice for each midterm. I'm sure if you do all of the course materials and read the textbook, you will definitely have no problems on the exams...but to be honest...you don't need to read the textbook. Again, it probably does help, but I didn't read it and have only lost points due to stupid errors (the topics of the midterms were sufficiently covered in course materials alone).We'll see how the final goes...Biochemistry is very pertinent to medicine, and Hughson gets that, so it's actually quite a cool class to take, and it should help with MCAT material.You're probably taking this because you need to, but you should not worry too much. If you go to lecture/review and understand the lecture notes before the exam (as well as do most of the PSET problems/practice exams), you can definitely do well on the exams.",,
"Exams require a lot of studying. But other than that, the course is good. I found it interesting overall.",,
Form a study group.,,
"If you're taking biochem you're taking it because you have to for pre-med.  The material, which is a bit of a cross between biology and organic chemistry, is generally pretty interesting once you understand it. But this is not a course you should be taking unless you need it for a MOL departmental or are premed.  The problem sets are graded for completion which is nice, but they often 5+ pages long and can take hours to do, which seems a bit excessive for a weekly non-graded assignment.  Every lecture has graded clicker questions that are worth 10% of your overall grade, which made them feel unnecessarily stressful.  Exams were generally difficult but fair.  The exams are curved but not very generously.  Overall, just be prepared to put in a lot of time trying to learn the material in order to get a decent grade.",,
if you're in this course it's probably bc you have to be so try to enjoy it,,
I enjoyed this course more than I thought I would. Professor Hughson is a gem!,,
"Make sure you start off well. Review lecture notes and attend precept. I personally found the amount of memorization to be a lot, but it's not the worst class to take.",,
"Get a good start and read the book early and often, keep a rhythm going to get used to the volume of the material at once.",,
"Professor Hughson is a good lecturer, although I didn't care much for the clicker questions. I learned a lot, although the administration of the course could be improved.",,
ATTEND HUGHSON's OFFICE HOURS AND LAUGH AND LEARN,,
"Biochem is hard but Prof. Hughson does a really great job lecturing and precepts are pretty helpful in making sure you actually understand the material. Make sure to give yourself plently of time to study for exams and utilize the materials (study guides, past exams) that are posted for that purpose.",,
"This class is A LOT. By a lot, I mean a lot of content, informational synthesis and studying required. But, the class is interesting so this should make studying feel a bit less dreadful.",,
"This is still pretty difficult, but a lot easier to enjoy than Orgo, at least in my opinion.  You get to learn so much cool stuff, plus it's not in the CHM department so they at least pretend to care about you.",,
"This was a good course, but be prepared to enter into very high stress environment. In addition, the course is definitely very memorization heavy.",,
"The class is taught well, but the exams are insanely difficult.",,
Continuously be studying for this class. There is a lot to memorize but the course really starts to come together in the last third. It is difficult but as long as you stay on top of the material you can do well!,,
"I would take this class. It is definitely challenging with all of the information you have to know, but the teaching staff was great. From the beginning, it felt like they were on our side, and they provided ample resources that we could use to learn the material. I had a really positive experience. I learned a lot.",,
"If you are taking this course, you probably need it for a requirement. Professor Hughson's lectures are very well done and give a good overview of the textbook readings. As with any course, precepts can be hit-or-miss, but Collin is great if you can get him as a preceptor. The textbook reading is not required, but it is very helpful if you do it as many of the clicker questions come from the textbook and the answers to the more confusing PSet questions can be found there, too. Personally, it got hard to keep up with the reading in the second half of the semester, so skim and command F the online textbook if you don't have time to read the whole reading. Lecture attendance is essentially mandatory as the clicker questions are graded. Pay attention to the key concepts docs posted before the exam. If they tell you to know a mechanism from the textbook (ie HIV protease), know the mechanism, intimately. The subject material of this course is pretty interesting and, even though there is a hefty bit of memorization, you will learn a lot if want to.",,
"Pretty good course - it's a lot of work and definitely not easy, but the content is doable and well-taught.",,
"You're probably taking this class because you have to but it's also incredibly interesting and ended up being one of my favorite courses at Princeton. You must take the fight to this class rather than let this class take the fight to you. Falling behind will make you absolutely miserable, but staying ahead of the tsunami is incredibly rewarding and in the end worth it. Here's how to get an A in this class. Before lecture you should skim the chapters covered and review the previous lecture (15-20 mins x 3 lectures probably over breakfast). Then you pay attention in class, it's not hard class is lively and interesting. After class go back and do the readings (or at least skim them with the slides next to you) (1-2 hours) and do the ALL of the recommended problems (2-4 hours). I would recommend going to the weekly office hours every week (1 hour) but it's not critical. You must pay attention in precept but do not do the precept problem sets outside of precept. You don't get answers to these and therefore they are a worse learning tool than the recommended problems. Ah also go over the regular problem sets for about an hour after you get them back every week (1 hour). If you have done this every week (5-9 hours/week), you can rest easy. Come exam week you just need to do the practice tests (timed!) and spend one day cramming on top of all of your understandings and you will ace every exam.  There are 2 midterms basically back to back then a few weeks and then the cumulative final so doing the work on front end will mean less time spent in the end and more fun with the material! I understand if you don't have 5-9 hours/week to spend on biochem but I would recommend you make time somehow or push this class to another semester.",,
"I realize this course is a requirement for many, so you must take it.1. Do the readings ahead of time so that lectures are not confusing or bewildering.2. Although the professor does not explicitly tell you to memorize many things, the expectation on exams is that you will have it memorized. So, memorize! Compounds, enzymes, equations, reaction mechanisms, all of them. 3. Understand that the assumption is this is the only class you're taking. So it's important to be sure you always have your iClicker to answer questions. 4. Do not take this class if you do absolutely do not have to do so.",,
It's a hard class but Professor Hughson makes it very clear what you need to do in order to do well. DO THE READINGS!!!!! FINISH THE PSETS!!!! REVIEW THE LECTURES!!! This class is different from orgo in that it requires more memorization rather than application of concepts (you still gotta do that though). It's A LOT of material so make sure to stay on top of readings. The review sessions with Izzy are super helpful and a good time to ask any questions you may have.,,
"If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it. So there's nothing I can say except don't fall behind. If you fall behind, it is just a lot of content to catch up on. Also if you're looking at this class and you don't have to take it, don't.",,
This course is manageable.,,
"do practice problems early, understand/memorize the lectures, don't read the textbook (skim if anything)",,
"This course is really amazing--very interesting and engaging, and better designed than most other pre-med requirements. Hughson really gives a sense of the arc of the material and keeps bringing it all together in beautiful ways. That said, the course is HARD and it is often difficult to keep up when the semester moves fast and you have other coursework to do. Read the textbook!!!  Take with Hughson, and you'll at least be inspired even if you struggle",,
"It a lot of content, but put in the work with the psets and the textbook and you'll do alright. The exams are fair and the lectures (if Hughson is teaching) are really interesting.",,
"The course covers a lot of material, so make sure you understand the concepts as you learn them so you do not have to cram the material before an exam. Discuss problem sets with peers and attend office hours.",,
"Go to all lectures, read over notes while listening to recorded audio again after class.",,
"Not as painful as I expected! Kind of fun and interesting. Great professor and preceptor, office hours are super helpful (if you are caught up enough). Hughson is very clear, knowledgeable, and gives off lots of dry humor. I didn't stay caught up throughout the weeks so exam times were very challenging. SO MUCH MATERIAL. set aside lots of time to review.",,
"Do the readings and study as you go, don't save all of your review for the night before the exam. You will learn a lot from this course as long as you put in the work.",,
"Pretty difficult in the time leading up to exams/the exams themselves. For clicker questions, briefly look through your notes before lecture starts. Hughson is a great lecturer and the material is really interesting.",,
"This course is better than orgo, but don't let that fool you into thinking that its easier or less content-heavy. The first exam is much easier than the rest of the course, so really lean into the content after the first exam. Read the textbook, study the content every day, practice memorizing the structures of molecules that come up frequently, and really focus on consolidating material as it comes. Hughson is a great lecturer and most of the TAs are really good.",,
"The material is difficult, there's no way around that, but make sure to go to lecture and study the lectures notes! Professor Hughson puts a lot of effort into teaching the course and honestly, makes teaching look fun!",,
I would recommend going through the lecture notes and powerpoints as the main source of studying. The textbook is helpful if you don't understand something in particular but it is not absolutely necessary.,,
"My favorite chemistry class by far at Princeton. I went into it very apprehensive because I've never done well in chem, but this was different from what I was expecting. The chemistry is a supplement to a lot of biological functions that we talk about, and it was really interesting to see how they were all related. Hughson is sweet but a bit of a rule-follower, and lectures were decently interesting with his comments. There are graded clicker questions every lecture. Most people taking this class have to because they're either MOL or pre-med, but if you need it for a certificate or something, definitely not the worst class to take. It's too much work for a class just for fun, but I think it's pretty well taught, the tests are reasonable, but beware of the amount of memorization that goes into this class.",,
Take with Professor Hughson! He is a really amazing lecturer.,,
"Yes, take it, it requires lots of investment but worth it.",,
"If you can take it with Prof. Hughson, you should. He's a fantastic lecturer. For tests, just focus on reviewing lecture slides/notes (psets if you have time), and then use practice tests to see what you need to review again. If you're taking it with Hughson make sure to reread the previous lecture notes before each lecture so you can get the clicker questions.",,
read over the previous lecture notes and you will get 100% on the clicker questions,,
"Precept and lecture are important, so make sure you attend.",,
Professor is sincere and very interested in BioChem. Form study groups.,,
"Biochem with Prof. Hughson was solid. The course spends most of its time on metabolic processes, which are interesting but also have a lot of detail, and this class requires you to retain a lot of information. Try not to fall behind, because memorizing everything before the test (as I learned) is difficult.",,
"This course is really hard. Prof. Hughson explains things very well and always puts them into broader contexts, but that doesn't change the fact that you will be barraged with information and expected to know every detail of it. Be prepared to study a LOT.",,
"You gotta do what you gotta do. Nothing I write in this will make all you pre-meds out there change your minds if you've made it this far. However, you should know that (unlike orgo or other premed classes you have probably taken already) the sheer volume of content in this course will make it feel like like you're trying to take a drink of water from a fire hose that is ripping your face to shreds. It might be a good idea to go to lecture and attempt to keep up from day one. That being said, Professor Hughson's lectures are very clear and make the experience as acceptable as possible. Have fun. Don't stress too much. Grades don't really matter anyways.",,
"Keep up with the material every week! If you fall behind, the material will seem overwhelming when it comes time to study for exams. There is a lot of memorization. This class was harder than orgo.",,
Stay engaged in precept and ask lots of questions. Be sure to keep a big picture lens on metabolism so you don't get lost in all the details.,,
"Ended up dropping the course 3/4 of the way through. I found Professor Hughson to be abrasive at times. There are clicker quizzes at the beginning of each class and clicker questions throughout the rest of the lecture, all graded. What was really annoying was that quizzes begin at 10:01 so you had to be on time, but then lectures would go several minutes over or there would be a clicker question after 10:50 when some students had to leave to get to their next class. Problem sets are graded on completion, which is nice. They barely factor into your grade though, and if you don't do so well on a test or just aren't a great test taker in general, it's pretty hard to bring your grade up.This class throws sooooo much material at you, and although Professor Hughson will claim that there isn't much memorization in the class, it's almost all memorization. The sheer amount of information you're expected to know for exams is a bit ridiculous. I guess it ends up being helpful for the MCAT. Take it if you have to, find memorization strategies that work for you",,
"This is a great, engaging, and well-organized class. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about biochemistry. Dr. Hughson is witty, knowledgeable, and unexpectedly funny.",,
"Try to take it with Professor Hughson! He does such an amazing job at teaching everything you need to know during lecture. I did not study from the textbook, only from the slides and notes and I didn't feel like I missed anything. Go to all lectures and don't stress out too much about the graded clicker questions.",,
A lot of memorization in this course -- good luck,,
"I didn't do exceptionally well in this class so don't take my word as coming from someone really smart who did super well- it was an interesting class! Yeah it is a hard class unless you study biochem for 10-20 hours a week (I most did not- didn't study at all so didn't do fantastic but whatever) but it is well taught. Hughson makes the lectures super interesting so if you're into this kinda stuff, know that it sucks as all chem type classes do but the Prof is cool and he makes the course interesting and funny. You will need an iClicker for it (get one from a friend), the textbook is actually pretty well written (didn't read too much of it but what I did read was good), exams are tough (unless you study as I said above, I did not), but weekly problem sets are completion only. Precept is annoyingly 1.5 hours long but it is what it is. You're probably taking it because it is required but just know that it is not as bad as Orgo was!",,
"This course is really challenging, so it's probably smart to keep up with it rather than try to cram. Clicker questions might be a good motivation to review stuff before every class. Prof. Hughson is a good lecturer and the review sessions are helpful!",,
"Biochem is a really interesting course and fun for premed. You get to learn a lot about the body, and the course material is taught well.",,
"This class is definitely hard, but manageable. Pay attention in lecture, do the readings before the exams, study old clicker questions, psets, and practice exams. The exams will never throw something totally out of left field at you.",,
