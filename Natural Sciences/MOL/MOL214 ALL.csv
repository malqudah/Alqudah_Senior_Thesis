Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"good intro class for bio. I didn't take AP bio so it was quite a challenge for me to understand/memorize concepts and vocab -- but even then I averaged around ~B. Professors are very good. Pre lab quizzes are very easy, no need to stress about them too much. If you don't want to buy a clicker it's not required.",,
"They post slides, but going to lectures is much better. If you go to lectures, there's really no reason to do the readings. Problem sets are pretty short and straightforward. Labs are fun too.",,
This class is required for a lot of people but it's still a great introductory class. There's some pretty interesting concepts and precepts are really helpful for solving and understanding p-sets.,,
"Although you will most likely take this class because you have to, it is a great introduction to Molecular Biology. The lecturers and preceptors are both fantastic.",,
"Take this course if you're interested in biology. The material's not easy but if you put in the work you can do well. Problem sets are pretty self-explanatory and you get time to go over it with other students, while labs are always interesting and yield tangible results. Exams are tough, but so are exams in all the other classes here.",,
Best class to know if you like premed stuff,,
"You don't really need to do the readings in the textbook, just take good notes on the lectures. Go to anyone for help, they are all there to help you succeed. This is probably one of the more well organized courses and all of the instructors are fantastic. Although it is definitely difficult to get an A in the class.",,
Awesome course!! It really makes you excited about biology and wanting to learn more. The professors and AIs are super helpful and nice.,,
"If you stay on top of your work, the class is very manageable.",,
Take the most advantage of precept (dr. McDonald is especially helpful and really nice!),,
"Go to office hours, and expect to see weirdly worded questions on exams.",,
"Use the textbook only to clarify confusing sections from lecture. Also, make sure to do the problem sets on your own first before checking them in precept with other students.",,
The precepts are very helpful in explaining the concepts and go over the entire pset. The lectures are dense but I thought they were well presented and interesting.,,
"While it is not necessary to read all of the supplemental materials posted for each lecture, I would highly recommend it as they help orient the reader for oncoming topics as well as provide some degree of clarification. Furthermore, precept is an ABSOLUTE must. It is by far the most useful review material provided, and can honestly be fun at times!",,
"Go to office hours. Know the learning keys. Pay attention in precept, and do the psets.",,
Go to the lectures and you will be fine. This class is manageable.,,
This is a solid introductory course for molecular biology. It covers a range of topics giving you the basic knowledge you need to move forward.,,
Pay attention in lecture; don't ignore the details; and put effort into studying a bit outside of class.,,
Its an interesting class if you really enjoy biology,,
Review your notes EVERYDAY. There is a lot of memorization required to succeed in this class.,,
"As a MOL major, I actually didn't like this class for some reason. I found lectures pretty interesting and Notterman and Gavis are exceptional at teaching. However, I thought that precepts (on campus) were more of a waste of time (too much group work that doesn't work out) and I thought that the labs were boring (however, Dr McDonald and Dr Thieringer are amazing teachers--it was just the content). Psets are easy to get done in <1 hour the night before, but since they are ""easier,"" prepare to be more surprised about the difficulty on quiz/midterm/final. A lot of the questions on quiz/midterm as described by my friends and I could have had ""multiple correct answers."" I would say to avoid this, try to not overthink questions and also study with friends. It's good practice to try to say out loud the main takeaway of each slide from the lecture. I would encourage you to go to office hours (especially Dr McDonald's, she's amazing, I wish I had her as a tutor all year) every week with questions from the two lectures that week to make sure you actually understand the content. Since precepts are mandatory, get precept with Dr McDonald!",,
"Really great course for gaining an appreciation of biology. Professors Gavis and Notterman are both thorough, engaging, and receptive. Since Professor Notterman is a pediatrician, he often includes clinical presentations of the concepts we learn, which adds a nice touch to lecture especially if you're looking to go into medicine. Dr. McDonald is a fantastic preceptor and helps you synthesize and organize all the information you learn. Light workload, and labs are light as well, but it's important to study hard for exams.",,
"Even if you're not planning on majoring in a biomedical department, you have to take this class! It really isn't much of a time commitment but you'll come out of MOL214 with a strong foundation of how molecular biologists tackle the toughest of problems and the properties of what makes us... us! Dr. Gavis is an absolute sweetheart and Dr. Notterman's obsession with cats is incredibly adorable. Even though labs are three hours long, I looked forward to them every week as a kinesthetic learner; when else would we be able to work with bacteria and nematodes? I agree, the exams could be somewhat based on pure memorization, but aside from that, it is a truly amazing class that you should highly consider.",,
"Bring something interesting to do to labs, it's so much waiting.",,
I learned a lot!,,
If you take the time to study. You'll be fine.,,
"Of the intro courses I've taken here at Princeton (MAT, EGR, CHM, PHY, CBE, MSE) I have to say I found this one to be the most organized and most enjoyable. I ended up PDFing this course because I chose to focus on departmentals instead, but somehow with the pressure of grades off my shoulders I still put my all into this class because the material was that interesting. The TAs and preceptors are great at including everyone and keeping the workload very reasonable, and the lectures cover interesting case studies at times that make the concepts come to life.",,
I actually REALLY enjoyed this class!! I didn't expect to love it because it is just an introduction biology class and required for EEB and a pre-med requirement. But all of the teaching staff were so invested. Notterman and Gavis are great lecturers. I loved Dr. McDonald as my preceptor. Surprisingly this has been my favorite class this semester.,,
"This course will start out easy, but pick up and become difficult extremely quickly. I recommend reviewing concepts constantly, as it is so easy to forget them. Stay on top of assignments, and precept will help you with your understanding as well as completing the p-sets. Don't be afraid of any of the instructors. They are all kind and helpful. They know their stuff and just want to pass on their passion to you.",,
"The material is very interesting but there is a ton of it.  Extremely difficult class, especially if you don't have a ton of biology experience from before.  I wish I had studied a lot more than I did, because the material adds up and it's tough to memorize everything.  Labs and lectures are interesting and precepts are good.  You have to be willing to commit a lot of time to studying or else you'll struggle.",,
"MOL214 is an interesting and engaging intro to molecular bio. I was honestly shocked at how much I had learned by the end of the year, it goes so far beyond the AP Bio I learned in high school and I'm really grateful for that! Getting to do labs experiments that directly relate to skills I'll need for research in the future was amazing. The lectures were really interesting but can be detailed and Professor Notterman tends to lecture quickly so it can be hard to keep up with note-taking. Reading the textbook isn't necessary as its more detailed than the course, unless you have a specific question.",,
A good amount of work and memorization. Not crazy hard.,,
This is a super fun and interesting course! I had to take it for a departmental requirement (EEB) but I ended up enjoying this course a lot!,,
"In 2020, the connectivity of the lectures was low, and the textbook contained way too much information, meaning you couldn't really read it. I thought this was an intro course, but the professors and lab instructor will often say ""hopefully you already knew that."" I didn't usually already know ""that,"" and this really bugged me. It won't be as interesting as your high school biology, and the lab reports are SO mundane and require no critical thinking. Some of the topics are great, but most feel super random. You will have to memorize everything from each example because this course really fails to actually connect the examples in a meaningful way. Is that what molecular biology is? Maybe we don't know enough about it yet to be able to actually look at it as a whole system?",,
"Stay organized! Don't be afraid to ask the professors any questions you have, they are really friendly and helpful!",,
"This class is almost 95% memorization. If you don't have the mental space for all of the small details and names of things that come with this class, I don't know if you should take it. I had to take this class for pre-med, like many others, so it may not be a choice for some people. The subject matter was interesting when you stepped back to think about it, but in the moment, it was very stressful for me having to learn (and commit to memory) all of the material.",,
"As someone who enjoys biology and has experience in STEM/MOL courses at Princeton, this one disappointed me. The lecturers are amazing, and very helpful, but that's about where it ends. The readings were a waste of time, the problem sets and precepts were helpful at explaining concepts, but didn't really coincide with exam materials. There is no exam preparation, so you're on your own to study (you can always ak questions in office hours, though). Be prepared to have every exam or quiz you take to have at least one question with a mistake, and you're lucky if it's just one. If you have to take this course as a pre-req, it's not the worst thing, and you'll survive it, but otherwise, keep your expectations low.",,
"PRINT OUT THE LECTURE SLIDES. This is something I didn't figure out was useful until after the midterm but ITS SO WORTH IT! Lectures are semi-fast paced and if you aren't worried about copying what's on the lecture slide you can spend more time actually thinking about the concepts and writing down other important things that Notterman or Gavis say during lecture. Annotated lecture slides are an invaluable resource in this class that will help you review later on!! Also GO TO office hours!! Gavis and Notterman are wonderful at explaining concepts but I also really would reccomend going to Dr. McDonald. She's wonderful and an incredible teacher. Gavis, Notterman, and Dr. McDonald also write the exams so understanding what they focus on and how they describe certain concepts will help you do well on exams. Overall, this class is incredibly well-organized and well-taught and they don't ever quiz you on stuff they don't teach you. The wording of exam questions can be a little tricky so you really just have to read questions carefully and usually go with your gut.",,
"There is a lot of information in this course, but its SO INTERESTING. I would reccommend that people keep an active google doc, or a word document where they answer the learning goals after each lecture. I know it might seem tedious and take up time, however, this will help DRAMATICALLY come quiz or exam time because if you review these questions you are pretty much golden.",,
"This is a VERY dense course. You learn a lot and the material is very interesting. Professors do a good job of explaining complicated processes, relating them to relevant studies, and the lectures and labs correlate well. try to stay on top of your studying (by doing the lecture goals) throughout the course so you don't have to cram. Psets take no time and you usually go through the answers during precept each week. Psets and quizzes are not at the exam level at all!!! I found it difficult to get an A because of the exams -- I pretty much had a 100% in the class but one of the quizzes and midterm brought it down to a B.",,
"Review your notes as you go. This is a very detailed class, and you will be expected to spit out very specific information on tests. I suggest making a master study guide. Every week, go over the last two lectures and make outlines based on the guiding questions at the beginning of class. Add onto this sheet throughout the semester, and review the entire thing occasionally--even just skimming is better than nothing. By the end of the semester, you'll have everything in one nice place and will still be familiar with old topics.",,
Make sure to do problem sets before precept.,,
"I would recommend this course if you enjoy biology. It is a general science course that covers an expanse of material in some depth. The weekly work is manageable and though some of the readings are required, the lectures usually supply all of the information needed to do well on assessments. Also, the labs are pretty fun. However, this course does require time and effort to do well, since there is a lot to memorize and understand. I would recommend attending all of the precepts, since you review the homework before you turn it in. I would also recommend that you review key concepts questions provided at the start of each lecture and the individual assays/famous experiments mentioned in lecture before exams.",,
This is a very comprehensive course giving background on the basics of molbio and lab equipment and procedures. Quarantine changed the second half of the class for me but before quarantine it was not too difficult,,
Study nonstop and never think you know something because you actually don't.,,
It's not hard.,,
"There is a lot of content in this course and the midterm/final definitely required a lot of studying. But, I learned a lot and figured out ways to succeed. Prof. Notterman is a great lecturer.",,
"Wouldn't take it for fun, but if need to take for a department, it was fine",,
Very interesting course! Memorization heavy. The precepts help a lot with problem sets.,,
"The course has so much material to memorize it's insane. If you stick to it though, you can pass.",,
"A good bit of work and memorization, but this is a rewarding class that teaches you a lot abut the basics of cellular biology in a manageable format.",,
Go to lab office hours and McGraw group tutoring! Heard from a friend that it was really helpful and I personally wish I had done it more often.,,
"I loved this course! I took it junior spring (2020, so during coronavirus) for a premed req and it was honestly not as bad as I thought it would be based on the ratings it gets. It was also such a breath of fresh air after EEB211. Professor Gavis and Professor Notterman are amazing lecturers and the lecture content is up-to-date and engaging. If you like biotech, it's all there. We talk about CRISPR and RNASeq and stuff like that, its very contemporary. Preceptors are wonderful, labs are super interesting and straightforward and the grading is fair. Where this class gets challenging is not in the material (its not hard to understand), but in how much work you have to put in. So be cognizant of your schedule when you enroll. I took this with 2 departmentals and one easy PDF and it was manageable even with a JP due. take it!!!",,
"There can be a lot of information to keep up with, but the material is engaging and interesting. Make sure you go to lecture and review frequently to prepare well for exams.",,
"A lot of memorization, so start studying for exams early on. Problem sets are good practice for the exams, but are much easier.",,
very detail-oriented...be prepared for memorization.,,
"If you took Bio AP, you'll know most of the material (but if you're majoring in Mol you have to take it anyway for some reason). That said, it's a well-organized course and is very interesting. Might be hard if you know nothing about biology, but it's a good way to expand knowledge/review the topic. Reading is rarely necessary.",,
great course,,
Attend lectures. Go to Dr. McDonald with your questions.,,
"This is a difficult class but a fair course. The lectures are long but the lecturers are good. Labs are quite long, but lab reports are not overly formal or taxing.",,
Start studying early!! Don't fall behind in lectures,,
"The beginning of the course will be amazing. I've taken AP Bio (4) and I'm also pre-med, yet I've always had a subtle dislike for Biology in lieu of chemistry. However, this course really helped me regain my interest in Biology by explaining concepts first introduced in AP in different ways that made it stick in my head. If you've taken AP Bio and did relatively well, you'll get an easy A. However, I say the class was great in the beginning because Prof.Gavis was teaching them and she's a great lecturer who is clear and concise in how she teaches. Part-way into the semester, Prof.Notterman teachers lectures and his style of teaching is very jumbled and confusing. He often spends way too much time talking about topics not relevant to this course and ends up not having enough time to get through his entire lecture. It got very frustrating having to self-teach myself his lectures since he taught all the material NOT covered in AP Bio. If you're person who likes lecturers who go on tangents about their independent research or who spend hours on the title slide talking about some image not relevant to keep in your memory, then you'll love Prof.Notterman. It only got worse during the pandemic because he had no incentive to stop talking and keep to the 1H20 lecture time limit. All his lecture videos are way over that time limit, and I had to watch his videos on 1.2X the speed to digest it all in a reasonable amount of time. I wish Prof.Gavis had taught the second half because Prof.Notterman is more of a lab scientist than he is a good lecturer. For precept, make sure you get Karin McDonald because she sometimes can explain things better than Prof.Gavis does, and she does it in the small time frame of a couple of minutes. For lab, make sure you get Kevin DAmico. He's a young lab TA so he doesn't talk down condescendingly like other lab TAs and as long as you do what you got to do and aren't extra in your lab reports, he's an easy and reasonable grader. Overall, amazing pre-med class and easy A class. Maybe it's because I took AP Bio but I never experienced the pre-med curve or competition people usually talk about. I think people usually complain about that because a lot of the people in this class are upperclassmen who aren't that good at science :0 But if you study and prepare yourself, there's no way you can't get an A.",,
To do well it is important to memorize a lot of the material for the exams.,,
"Take this class if you're interested in biology at all! The first half is very similar to AP Bio, but the second half gets more interesting. Make sure you pay attention in lecture because it helps to go into precept prepared. The class is very well-organized.",,
This course is another one of the intro STEM courses at Princeton that seems to be as organized and seamless as it can possibly be. Take it for the pre-req it probably is. I'm sure the course is much more enjoyable if you are actually taking it on campus.,,
Take this class!  My only biology experience before this came from a class in my sophomore year of high school (not even AP Bio) and I was still adequately prepared for this course.  It involves a lot of memorization but the information is presented really well in lectures and precepts are a good time to clarify any questions.,,
I found this course pretty challenging. I worked really hard all semester but ended up having to PDF it (keep in mind this was coronavirus time though).,,
"Definitely take if you are interested in biology and want a semi-easy STL. If you've taken AP Bio or other honors high school biology, then much of the material will be a review, and even if not, you can catch on pretty quickly. Professors Gavis and Notterman are both excellent lecturers. Exams are straightforward but do require a good deal of memorization. Labs are three hours each (and they take pretty long, so you'll probably be there until the end), but some of them are pretty enjoyable, and I found it really fun getting familiar with pipettes, centrifuges, and other lab equipment.",,
"This is a good class. Lectures cover a lot of material, but precepts and problem sets emphasize what is really important.",,
"Definitely go to class. The lectures are well run and cover all of the information you will need. It helped me a lot to use the slides that they post for every lecture beforehand, so if you can print/use a tablet with them, I would definitely do that. The readings are helpful for studying, but I used them more if I needed extra explanation on a confusing topic, so don't stress about reading them too much. The lab reports are fairly easy, just follow the directions they give you. Sometimes they take a bit of time, but it's not bad. Also!! Make sure you print them before you go to lab because there are no printers in the building. The psets don't take too long, and you go over them in precept, so I would go to precept even if they aren't mandatory. This is a well-run class, and all of the professors do a good job of making themselves available if you need help.",,
"This course is super interesting! Lectures are presented clearly and in an organized manner. Be prepared for the exams though because, though I generally found the problem sets easy, the exams definitely called for mastery of more details and you have to be able to move through them at a good pace in order to finish. Summarizing lectures and processes in my own words at the end of the end of each week was helpful in keeping me on track -- this is not a course that you can cram for the night before the exam! Also, for lectures, I found it helpful to print out the lecture slides beforehand and take notes on them since it is impossible to write down all the info/pictures they are going over during the lecture, and the slides themselves say basically everything you need to know.",,
"Take good, detailed notes. Go back to past lectures throughout the semesters to avoid forgetting information. Make sure you understand how the lectures connect, as it will help see the big picture.",,
Pretty standard bio class. Learn lecture material very well and you'll be fine in this class. Don't buy the book it's a waste of money,,
"Overall a really interesting class if you liked bio in high school. I didn't take AP bio in high school (I only did my school's intro course), but MOL214 did a really good job of starting off with the basics and expanding upon them, so it's not too hard to keep up even if you don't have much bio experience. The psets & precepts are pretty helpful in prepping you for quizzes / exams, and the labs are generally really interesting and fun. The exam questions can be a little ambiguous / hard to interpret at times, but other than that, this is a really solid and interesting course. Bio classes are usually notorious for forcing you to memorize *everything*, but this class does a good job of focusing on the bigger picture and asking more general conceptual questions on exams. Prof Gavis and Prof Notterman were really great lecturers, and they explained everything really thoroughly.",,
Take this course! The lectures are great (especially Professor Gavis - she's amazing) and the problem sets aren't bad. This is definitely a really interesting and well organized intro to biology!,,
"All the professors and TAs in this course were amazing. Even if the content may be daunting, help will be available should you need it.",,
"Overall I think this is a very challenging but rewarding course. There is a LOT of content and the exams test you on a lot of it so you really have to take the time to memorize the materials. While the labs are fun, they are also time-consuming. I would reccomend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about biology but be ready to spend quite some time for this class!",,
Very good course for anyone interested in biology. Very nice and receptive professors and interesting labs. Stay on top of lecture material and you'll do fine.,,
"This course offers a strong introduction to biology and the applications are very interesting and relevant! The whole team of MOL professors are incredible and very helpful, as well as the lab TAs. I found that having the lecture slides with me during lecture and taking notes on the slides was a good learning technique, as well as pre/reviewing with the textbook which is a great resource.",,
"This is a great prerequisite! It's very organized and the lectures are interesting and relevant. As long as you pay attention in lecture and study hard before exams you should be fine. The slides are a great resource, you don't need to do the readings unless you need clarification. However, if you never studied biology before I imagine this course would be pretty hard",,
be ready to work!,,
"This class is not very difficult if you have taken some biology classes in the past. There is a lot of help provided for the labs and problem sets. Lecture is long, but I do recommend going to them because some of the material you need to know is not on the slides but said in lecture.",,
Be prepared to memorize to succeed.,,
"There is a lot to memorize in this course. I found it really useful to study with another person--doing that helped me know which areas I actually understood and which areas I really needed to review. If you can, take this course with a friend, or find a friend in the class to study with!",,
"You?re probably taking this course because you need it for med school or for departmental prerequisites. It?s not a bad course; just go to lecture, pay attention during precept (try to get dr. mcdonald as your preceptor; she is amazing!), review (read: memorize) lectures for quizzes and exams, and follow instructions closely for lab reports. Not a super hard class to do well in; all the tools are made readily available to do well in this class!",,
"Lecture not necessary, but a huge amount of work is. I spent minimum 1.5 hours a day on the course. Do your problem sets after having memorized all the information from the slides. Also, no one attends office hours. Definitely worth going. Notterman is a professor who loves getting to know his students. He's always curious about your other interests and you never get the sense you are being a pain when you ask for help.",,
