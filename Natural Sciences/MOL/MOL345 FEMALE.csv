Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Don't take it unless you need to. It's a lot of memorization, remembering the name of XYZ intermediates, and the name of this enzyme in that one pathway. If that sounds fun to you, then maybe you'd like this class. Professor Yan is great though.",,
"This is a difficult course and it requires a lot of memorization. Tbh I wouldn't really recommend the course because of how heavy the workload is in terms of learning material, but if you have to take it go to office hours as much as you can. Start studying for exams at least a week before they happen.",,
"You do not take this class because you want to. Just make sure you set aside a lot of time for it, and once you get it done, it is like a weight lifted off your shoulders.",,
"Mostafavi's lectures are clear and concise, Yan's lectures are very long and detail heavy. Grading is a bit unclear since they don't believe in curving, but may adjust the grading scale if necessary",,
"I would not take this class with Professor Yan if possible unless she changes her style of teaching. Dr. Mostafavi, however, was really helpful and accessible and provided a lot of support in and out of class. Generally, this class is tough and LOADED with material. It's a lot. The content is interesting but you're going through it so fast that it can feel pretty overwhelming sometimes. I would try to allot enough time to absorb some of the material outside of class so that it doesn't get to be too much by the time exams roll around. Good luck!",,
This course started out great and was interesting but when we switched to the second professor halfway through it went downhill. If Dr. Mostafavi taught this whole course I would highly recommend it. But if you don't need to take this class I wouldn't. But I do think it is better than orgo for all the premed students.,,
"I?m happy I took this class in the spring as the smaller class size (21 students) allowed for more individualized learning. Also, whoever usually teaches in the spring and apparently sucks didn't teach this semester, periodt.Dr. Mostafavi at the beginning half of the semester was such a sweetheart. It was her first time teaching and she absolutely did her best to ensure students understood what was going on in lecture as well as had an enhanced learning experience and the resources necessary to succeed in her course. Probably because she?s a young person herself in tune to how undergrads learn best and truly understands what students could really benefit from in hard courses such as biochem. She even gave us the opportunity to increase our grades by completing assignments on the online version of the textbook via Achieve (which she gave us free course access to)!!I wish the MOL cross listed courses would stop switching professors halfway through the term as it?s a big demand for students to try and accommodate new teaching styles in the middle of the course. Dr. Yan. who taught the second semester, had never taught undergrads before us and it was truly evident in the fact that she would prepare 100+ lecture slides for 50 minute lectures. She focused on things we didn?t need to know for the exam and overall was more excited about talking about her own research in the MOL department than actually teaching us what we need to know for the course. I guess they balanced one another out as Dr. Mostafavi taught her lectures better but had a more expansive and slightly difficult Exam 1 (got an A), while Dr. Yan taught her lectures poorly (honestly did other work during her lecture) but had a VERY easy exam (got an A as well). Lecture attendance is mandatory because you have to do clicker questions throughout the lecture.Nour was a terrible preceptor from day 1 and I personally sent email complaints to Dr. Mostafavi (as she?s more down to earth and serious about listening to and being receptive about student feedback/trying to implement things students say would be helpful). Nour acted like a tru a$$ and would answer student questions by saying things like ?it's in the textbook? or ?you should have seen that in the textbook if you did the reading?. Like we get it, you?re smart and know the material. How about you actually teach us?? Wish she wasn?t the only preceptor.Overall, as long as you put in the work and give yourself enough time to study on a daily grind for this class it is so doable. I?ve gotten As on all the exams so far (lets see what that final has in store) and anticipate getting an A overall in this course. Took this in a light semester with this being my only STEM course as a STEM major pre-med. Take the class with friends to study with and do precepts with and you?ll be fine.",,
"This class has been the bane of my existence for a year.  I took it with Hughson and then it caused me so much strife that I dropped it and took it again this semester.  This semester was 100% better because the professors actually interacted with us and there was a much smaller class.  Definitely take the spring over Hughson because he is harsh and a it was much more difficult.  Dr. Mostafavi's first half was fantastic, I've never understood a STEM class better than how she taught it.  Dr. Yan's half was not that fun cuz she through out way too much material and we didn't know what we needed to know, but she was still so kind and fun to listen to.  It's obviously a difficult class, but it is definitely easier in the spring.",,
"Hello young one. Do not take this course with organic chemistry. Take orgo beforehand. I think that you need need need to go to office hours, the lectures in the second half especially had so much information that there is no way to understand what is important and not unless you do. The precepts were not that helpful to me personally, but your preceptor is often more accessible than your professors so utilize that. It's so much memorization. It's too much memorization. Be ready to take at least an hour a day outside of class, 7 days of a week if you want a C or higher. Because that's not happening for me.",,
"Don't take this course if you don't have to. You basically have to memorize every little detail on most slides (there are around 100 per lecture) and they don't really tell you what you have to know for exams, so you have to study everything. Lectures are not the most interesting, but you have to go for clicker questions. Good luck!",,
Memorize everything in the notes for this course.,,
need to be fully invested in this course to do well. read the textbook. start studying early for exams. do all the problem sets and try on the clicker questions to get your participation points up. the tests are hard,,
Form a study group.,,
"Please please please do not take this class in the spring. The profs are highly disorganized and we had no idea what was going to be on each test. If you enjoy memorizing all know biochemical cycles only to asked gen chem questions then this class may be for you. Just take it in the fall with an actual prof. It still probably won't be fun but at least you will maintain your will to live. I am literally begging you, don't do this to yourself.",,
