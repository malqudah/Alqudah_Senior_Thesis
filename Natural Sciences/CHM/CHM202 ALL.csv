Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Do all of the PSETs! Go to McGraw! Meet with Dr. Francis!,,
"Prepare for lecture because they are very confusing. Lectures are a good review for what you learn on your own, and not very good at teaching you without you being prepared.",,
"first unit is purely theoretical, but after that you'll be back to a lot of equations. do read/skim the textbook (for the units that you can) and check your psets after they're graded. and try not to miss lecture or you will struggle.",,
all the problem sets help,,
"its a lot, but great course. if you do it all, you learn chemistry well by the end. be prepared to commit fully and you'll be fine.",,
"Do what you gotta do, kiddos",,
"This is your classic introduction to chemistry course. I thought there was a lot of support which was helpful, but be aware that you will have to put in significant time preparing for assessments.",,
"I took this course after not enjoying CHM201, and I was pleasantly surprised. I found Prof. Bocarsly to be an engaging lecture who conveyed the information in a manner accessible to the students (something that I did not experience in lecture in CHM201). Lectures were recorded and Dr. Francis also provided us a copy of her notes. This was a huge plus, as Dr. Francis is an impecable note taker. One more pro-tip...try to sign-up for either John or Calvin's precept. These guys are absolute legends and just have this way of explaining difficult concepts intuitively. The Chem department should give these guys a raise!",,
Dr. Francis is the best thing to ever happen to the Gen Chem department. Absolutely amazing. The best human being. She made both semesters of chemistry livable.,,
"The course is very interesting and honestly I had no complaints and felt like everything was very fair up until the final. Study the last unit SO HARD, because it seems as if the other units were just irrelevant in the final, although we were told that 50% of the final would be older units, that just isn't true! Get a good preceptor. John or Calvin seem to be overwhelmingly better than the other preceptors. Honestly pray.",,
Hard but doable! Dr. Francis is the best. Literally listen to her every word and she will get you through the class.,,
"Probably nobody will be taking this class unless they're a science major and/or premed. In any case, I was the latter and I found it fun. It can be a LOT of hours a week, but as someone who did not take AP chem, I would say lectures are necessary and textbook readings not as much (but definitely useful).",,
"ask questions!!! cannot stress that enough. and use the practice materials of your Ta's and Dr. Francis, those help a lot",,
Go to lectures and go to precepts. precepts are sooo helpful,,
"This course can be time-consuming but is very manageable, and much more manageable than CHM 201. The p-sets are not too long or difficult and there are only a few lab reports. Take notes during lectures and reading the textbook and working through the example problems is really helpful. Professor Bocarsly and Professor L'Esperance's lectures were ok, some TA's office hours are really helpful, some are not. Go to office hours to work on p-sets or lab reports when needed. Overall this is a pretty standard Gen Chem course, not amazing but no reason to avoid taking it!",,
"Take this course if you have to. CHM202 is much better than CHM201, but take advantage of your resources! Dr. Francis is an abosolute GEM. Go to her office hours and ask questions when you do not understand anything. Start studying early and use the psets to help you study.",,
"When studying for exams, use the test questions at the end of every chapter. Use Dr. Francis's lecture notes and the annotated problems that she posts, they are extremely helpful. If you can, try getting Calvin Spolar as your preceptor. If you took CHM207, the lectures in this class don't stick quite as much to the textbook, but it's still very good for review and you should use it for the practice problems that are in the textbook. The first exam isn't too bad, but the second exam is, so definitely make sure to review and do LOTS of practice problems. The labs are pretty well structured, although they can take a lot of time. Bocarsly can sometimes explain things in a way that makes it more confusing than it needs to be, and if that happens your best bet is to ask your preceptor about it. The quality of your preceptor will affect how difficult the course is for you, especially for the topics towards the 2nd half of the semester.",,
Read the textbook,,
"Likely taking this as a prereq, go to office hours and look through textbook when in need of help.",,
"This class is unavoidable as a pre-med requirement so be prepared to self-study for a lot of the content! Overall, the material was pretty interesting though.",,
Do not take this course unless you have to for a requirement.,,
Make sure you are understand and keeping up with each week's lectures or else it is very easy to fall behind.,,
Much better than CHM 207!,,
read the textbook,,
"If you ever have a question, resolve it right away. The content builds on itself and the course will become difficult if you are unclear on a foundational concept. Overall, CHM 202 was not that difficult. Focus on learning the concepts and the grades will come. Good luck!",,
"If you are in 201 and haven't taken chemistry in some capacities before, you might want to prepare earlier for the second half of the semester. The exams are much harder than the practice material given.",,
Use your resources (McGraw and TA hours),,
"I would advise doing a lot of practice problems to review, especially with topics like kinetics, acids and bases, buffers, electrochemistry and making sure to continue reviewing older topics throughout the semester so final exam time is a bit easier",,
Attend precepts,,
I would only take this course if you absolutely have to and be prepared to do a lot of work outside of class.,,
"I would never take this course again. It was so hard for being an introductory chemistry class. I think this class showed me that I never want to study anything related to science because of how discouraging the course is. Even with a general sense of the overall concepts for each unit, they somehow find a way to make sure that you feel as though you do not understand what is being taught of you. I thought I learned from my mistakes in CHM 201 but I was surely mistaken.",,
Try to stay awake and listen to lectures.,,
"Only take this course if it is needed to fulfill a requirement. Other than that, study hard (when concepts become confusing in lecture, sometimes the textbook can help elaborate on the concepts). Textbook reading is not mandatory, but I suggest looking at the textbook chapters before lectures.",,
Great class! If you've taken 207 some of the material is a repeat (which is actually pretty nice). Staying on top of the readings can be useful but often Bocarsely doesn't necessarily follow the book.,,
I would absolutely take this course,,
"Continuation of CHM 201, same amount of workload if not a bit heavier",,
This class isn't terrible if you are willing to put in the work. You must keep up and synethesize the material as you go don't wait till the last moment. Test 1 is good test 2 is basically all math so it depends if you like math or not. Read the textbook it is actually helpful. GO TO DR. FRANCIS SHE IS AWESOME AND HELPFUl. also go to the Professor's office hours he is really nice and helpful and will explain clearer,,
"Please, for the love of everything good-- only take this course if you have to. This course feels like three courses in one. There is SO MUCH work and SO MUCH of a time commitment. Lectures are so intense (THREE TIMES A WEEK, EVEN FRIDAYS) and dry, labs are so intense for no reason, and precepts too. The material isn't horrible if presented in a better way. The professors are great people. (IF YOU'RE SIFP, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE DR FRANCIS' SIFP CHM DINNERS!!!) Dr Francis is the BEST!!!!! Go to her office hours!! Utilize every single resource CHM has to offer. Textbook was practically useless for most of the topics. This course is way too intense. Way too many exams. Two lecture exams (2.5 hours each), one final exam (3 hours), one lab practical (3 hours), one lab written (3 hours). These exams are no walk in the park. They are soooo intense and studying for them are a nightmare. Just go into this class knowing you'll struggle. Didn't enjoy this class one bit. Please look for a different course if you need a lab requirement.",,
"Tons and tons of practice problems will be so helpful in understanding the material that you cover in class. Do not be afraid to ask questions, especially during precept and office hours! Also, make sure to turn everything in on time since you can get a lot of points just from getting things in (and always go to lecture!)",,
Go to lectures and extra help,,
"I would not recommend this course to students unless you absolutely have to take it as a requirement for your department/pre-med. The material is not fun to learn, difficult and challenging, and there is a hefty workload expected for the course. Grading heavily depends on exams alone (65%) and does not give much credit to the long PSETs and long lab reports we have to work through. Despite Dr. LEsperance being a great instructor and very understandable, and Dr. Francis being incredible at her job, Prof. Bocarsly does not explain concepts well and often struggles to present dense content in a way that's student-friendly.",,
Attend lectures.,,
"If you hated 201, I recommend that you give this course a shot. It?s a lot more qualitative and generally a more interesting class in my opinion",,
This course requires you to teach yourself on your own time AND go to lectures. Although not helpful the small side notes of lecture may be on the exam as a bonus,,
Study hard,,
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNDER ANY circumstances!!!!,,
"Only take if you have to - it's a difficult course that requires a lot of work and the exams are hard, but it is interesting if you're interested in the field.",,
DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS U ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. ONLY BAD THINGS COME FROM THIS. BE PREPARED TO NOT PASS THIS CLASS.,,
"Better than GenChem 1 since it has the more interesting topics, as well as having instructors that seem to love teaching. Resource center is always helpful, as long as you know what your question is; can get quite busy on PSET due date which can be unfortunate but just show up early and you should be peachy keen. Exams aren't that bad, but you will have to study. If you don't prepare, you might end up needing to derive whole formulas and concepts during the exam; not a good thing if you are on a time-crunch.",,
Go to office hours,,
"Follow up on lectures after they given (if there are notes posted on Canvas, use those to your advantage to refine your own notes), the problem sets are very similar to questions which appear on the exams, don't be scared of asking questions in precept",,
"If you are interested in chemistry, this is a very good class. The workload is not that bad, and you will learn a lot of cool things related to chemistry and real world life.",,
"I would advise other students to find a good study group for this class (including McGraw!), as it is helpful to talk with others about the main conceptual points in the class.",,
If you don?t have to?please don?t.,,
"Unless your pre-med or a chem major, do not take the class.",,
"i enjoyed the material and labs in this course, but the lectures don't really prepare you for the problem sets, so go to office hours / mcgraw and read the textbook beforehand. overall super manageable!",,
"The demos in class are super cool. Dr. Francis is a queen. Ask for support if you need it - dig through Canvas for lecture notes and precept materials, and don't be afraid to go to office hours, McGraw study hall, or just email the professors.",,
I would say manage your time well for this class because if you are behind it can drag you back. I would look at the weekly precept slides from John Ambrose's and do the practice problems from Kailyn. I would recommend going to McGraw work sessions for sets and also take advantage of the Resource Center in Frick.,,
CHM 201 was a better experience for me,,
"While taking this course, attempt to reach out to Lab TAs and preceptors as much as possible. They are extremely helpful, and good at helping you focus your studies on the important points of the course.",,
"Lectures will be so complicated and confusing. Just go to precept and they will ""dumb it down"" to the concepts you actually will be tested on. Preceptors are your BFFs",,
Just like 201 except change in lecture style. Also less aligned with textbook. I hope Dr. Francis lectures more in the future - she presents information that is so accessible to students,,
Go to all precepts! Skim over the textbook before lectures! Do lots of practice problems!,,
Take it if you have too. The staff are friendly.,,
Don?t take unless you have to and if you have to get ready to be confused,,
"Use outside resources (videos on youtube, etc.) to help you understand/simplify a concept.",,
"If you are CBE or pre-med and have to take this course, I would not be worried, especially if you like chemistry. The material is interesting and the course is organized, both of which will carry you through. Problem sets are not too bad at all. Labs are pretty fun, and Dr. Francis' lab videos will help you a ton with lab reports. If you have questions, clarify them with your TA during precept to stay on top of things and you should be good. Tests can be pretty hard, but not impossible to do well on.",,
"This is a basic intro science course at Princeton - if Bocarsly is course head, then more similar to CHM 207 than 201. Lectures are often very basic, psets are quick but are not representative of the exams, and the only practice problems for exams provided by the instructors are half the length or shorter when compared to the actual exams.",,
"Read the lecture notes and make ample use of TA practice question banks when studying for exams. Ask questions - they will get an answer. If you've made it here from CHM 207, you've got this.",,
It?s a weed out class for a reason,,
"Do the readings so you can follow lecture more easily, otherwise you will get lost.",,
"I would advise students taking this course to take advantage of instructor help (in precept, office hours, etc.) as much as possible. I also recommend attending all lectures, reading the textbooks, and taking good notes in order to best prepare for the class. Additionally, the review sessions before exams are pretty helpful, and I would advise students to attend when they can.",,
Bocarsly cannot even balance a chemical equation. Poorly ran and disorganized. Lectures often started late.,,
Make sure to attend every lecture! Office hours were also very helpful for problem sets.,,
"Make sure you stay on top of lectures. It often gets difficult to catch up if you miss a lecture, but asking questions in precept can go a long way. The psets are good review for tests and TAs hold review sessions.",,
"The class is interesting (that is the inherent nature of Chemistry, I love chemistry!), but it is badly organized and badly tested.",,
go to lecture and precept,,
"The class isn't quite as difficult as CHM 201, although it's still pretty involved. Make sure you get a good preceptor (John and Calvin are the literal GOAT. Can't tell you how helpful they were, and I didn't even have either of them as a preceptor) who will go over questions/psets to see how the concepts plug into possible test questions. If your preceptor isn't doing that in their precepts, I would privately ask them if they can start doing it, because that was definitely the thing that would've made the semester more manageable. Readings aren't super necessary unless you're way confused, in which case the book is generally pretty good at clearing things up. Doing practice problems are pretty critical to being prepared for the exams, especially since the psets don't really provide a comprehensive look at the problems they might throw at you. The key to doing well is knowing how the concepts interact with each other in the problems.",,
"I wouldn't recommend this course, but most students who are going into the STEM areas will have to take this course anyways.",,
"Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this course, especially if you haven't taken AP Chemistry in the past! Make sure to time your precept correctly so that you can ask questions about the PSET! Do labs and PSETS with your friends!! Read the textbook, especially for PSET questions!",,
"Great course, especially if you get Calvin or Brianna to help you out along the way. Take it, but be prepared and read the textbook!",,
"Even if Chemistry is not your forte, I think one thing to keep in mind is you can always reach out to faculty members and your fellow students for help. There's a lot of support in the chemistry department.",,
READ DR. FRANCIS' NOTES!!!!!!!,,
"this course is less basic level chemistry knowledge like 201 is. I find myself very good at chemistry and still struggled in this class. Be prepared to have to find outside resources to help you understand the material because the lectures can be quite confusing as well. Use Dr. Francis' notes!!! she has an excellent way of summarizing what we need to actually know. Study a lot for the tests by doing tons and tons of practice problems of every kind, they throw questions unlike the psets on the exams.",,
I would definitely use Dr. Francis's lecture notes. Super helpful and good summary of lectures.,,
The course was an intro chem class. Don't expect too much. Bocrasley is a good lecturer. Try to go to lecture because they are actually helpful if you pay attention.,,
"Don't take unless you have to. If you did fine in CHM 201, you should be fine. There is more practice material for exams in 202 except there are no official practice exams released, which is really annoying. Bocarsly is not a good lecturer.",,
You're probably taking this as a requirement- I don't know why else you would be,,
Do it! Especially if you have to!,,
"In my opinion, this course is much better than CHM 201. It is more qualitative, which I found to be refreshing. Prof. Bocarsly does a fairly good job of explaining the material.",,
"This class is paced slower than CHM 207/201, so it is easier to follow. Try to get Mulan as your lab TA, she's amazing!",,
