Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Amazing course! I would suggest that you form a study group to go over psets, and start working on them sooner than later. As for exam review, I relied on my preceptor's practice sheets. If you are deciding between CHM215 and CHM202, I definitely recommend CHM215.",,
"The answer is yes, take over 201 and 202. You'll never be bored in lecture - Chirik makes you appreciate the beauty and applications of chemistry. He is also really funny! However, be warned: the instructors do not hold your hand in this course. Sometimes the PSETs were so difficult that even the preceptor struggled to solve / explain the problems. One thing I found frustrating is that the professors were not as available for office hours as other classes (understandable I guess, they have other priorities), so definitely try to get the most out of every single office hours you go to. Chirik scheduled office hours the day after the PSETs were due, so I did not understand the point of that. . .  Anyway, go to office hours and review PSETs and you should be mostly fine on exams (average is in the 65 - 85 % range. I wouldn't say this course is necessarily ""harder"" than 201 and 202 - you just need a strong background in chemistry to do well. If you're struggling with concepts in lecture, watch Catherine Drennan's Gen Chem Lecture series on MIT Open Course Ware as a supplement. Labs are fine, just do the pre-labs well and ask Dr. Francis for help if you need, she's incredible.",,
"The PSETs can be difficult, but the course staff is very helpful. TA Scott was the best!",,
"Only take this course if you have a genuine interest or purpose for Chemistry, not just to get Chemistry credit. You will not be able to fully appreciate what this course has to offer.",,
I know that this course is smaller and looks like a better option that CHM202 but believe me it is not. If Professor Chirik is teaching this course please reconsider. We received our two exam results AFTER the add/drop period. The lectures were not enough to complete the Psets and I ended up learning the majority of the content in precept (Thanks Scott!).,,
"If you're deciding between CHM 201/207 + 202 or CHM 215, pick 215. Even though it technically covers the same amount of content it's less work as it's assumed you know certain basic concepts from AP Chem, and the class is curved generously with more than half earning an A-range grade and everybody else earning a B-range grade (C-range grades don't exist here, unlike other Gen Chem classes). Labs and precepts are great and lectures are of a decent quality. PSets take 5-12 hours per week. Do beware when you get towards the middle of the semester and you cover Molecular Orbital Theory and Crystal Field Theory as most AP Chem kids will not have seen these topics before and they're conceptually challenging to grasp. Also beware the end of the semester when you have a Lab Practical Final, Lab Written Final, and Course Written Final (ie avoid other classes that have more work during the second half of the semester if you take this class). Like most science classes, precepts are a must if you want to fully understand the material covered in lecture, and oftentimes lectures and precepts complement each other beautifully. Labs are a lot less work than most other science classes and simultaneously much more intellectually stimulating. Lastly, waking up at 9 AM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is so worth it if you take this class (unlike most other 9 AM classes, like ORF 309)",,
"As a chemistry major, I really loved this course and thought it was fantastically taught! It really got me excited about chemistry and the professors all did a great job introducing chemical topics in ways that weren't boring and went beyond just the basic ""what you need to know."" The psets and exams were difficult but fair, but I think office hours and precept were fantastic resources for this and so if you make it clear what you're confused about it'll be fine.",,
Engage with the course outside of class time more than you think you need to; go to office hours and read the textbook.,,
I would advise to ask questions in precept.,,
"Definitely take this class over CHM202. It is smaller, more flexible, and (from what I've heard) the same difficulty and more engaging.",,
"I would recommend that students interested in the field of chemistry should take this course. It is face-paced, but there are generally opportunities to receive help in this difficult course.",,
"Overall, this is a good course and not too much work. Going to office hours and asking a lot of questions is super important. Often, the pset problems don't make that much sense and seem unnecessarily tedious, but getting help from the TA makes it super manageable.",,
It's a fun experience. Interesting staff. They make 9 AM class enjoyable.,,
"Chemistry is hard no matter what, so try to take this course over CHM201 & 202. It's definitely a more engaging course because of Chirik's lectures. Chirik will say the textbook is useless but I found it very helpful! Just stay on top of the material as best as you can.",,
"Don't let the name scare you: this course is definitely manageable, and if you're deciding between this course and 201/202 or 207, definitely taking this course. The professors are great and concepts that you may have learned in AP/high school chemistry are taught in a fascinating way. You will 100% learn interesting chemistry in this course and it feels like something much better than general chemistry. The workload is manageable, but take time outside of class to fully understand new material so it doesn't pile up. Going to lecture is super important, as the posted slides for lectures are very minimal.",,
"Interesting class, definitely difficult. Dr. Francis is really helpful. Problem sets sometimes have really confusing/difficult questions so it's best to have a reliable study group.",,
"Attend lecture, read the textbook even if they tell you not to, and definitely watch all of the lab videos. PSETs are hard so get a study group to complete them",,
"I would strongly recommend taking this class over the CHM 201/207/202 variants. Despite sounding very difficult, this class was relatively manageable though you will have to work hard and teach a lot of the content to yourself outside of the class if you have never taken advanced chemistry before. That being said, there is decent support and the class isn't that difficult",,
Definitely take this course if you test out of CHM202.,,
Go to as many lectures as you can and take good notes. Prepare for the exam early and expect the class to be challenging.,,
"Take this! It is a fun class and offers a super engaging introduction to chemistry. The instructors and TAs are very available to help, and they make the material applicable in the real world, which makes it all the more interesting!",,
"This course was amazing.  I might be biased b/c I like chemistry, but I really think this course does a good job of re-teaching you the basics of high school chemistry at a faster pace.  The lectures, especially the ones taught by Chirik, are super engaging since he always relates things to the real world or to one of his funny stories.  Even though the lectures are at 9 AM, try your best to attend lectures because even the smallest detail might be useful in trying to finish your PSETs/exams.  Also, the exams might be slightly difficult - don?t let that deter you!  It?s meant to be challenging so that you learn, but not to discourage you.For the PSETs, try to attend office hours if you can b/c that?s how I survived.  Good luck!",,
