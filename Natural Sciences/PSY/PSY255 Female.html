Her lectures for this course were super interesting, and she is incredibly kind. Instead of making students sit through two fifty minute zoom lectures, she made the decision to switch to just one synchronous lecture with shorter asychronous lecture videos. This was a really good move and I think this class worked really well in the format she chose. She is also very organized and upfront with her expectations, which made doing every assignment much easier. She responds quickly to emails and is very helpful. Partway through the course, she sent out a survey about the way she's running the course, and she took the time afterward to talk through the responses she got and how she would address our concerns. As far as labs are concerned, they were kind of long for the content we went over in them (they were  very similar to the Social Psychology labs, with QALMRI and final project preparation, but the Social Psychology labs are 50 minutes whereas the labs in this class were 3 hours). It does count as a lab credit though. Also, Kerem made labs super fun!! He really made an effort to get to know everyone in his labs, and he was always ready to help out if we had any problems understanding the content. He is also very funny, which is good in a teacher you are spending three hours per week with. Overall, this course was really really great!</div>

Professor Lombrozo is great and really wants students to understand the material, and it shows in her enthusiasm when teaching. Other than that, readings are reasonable, lectures are fun and informative, and exams being open-note doesn't hurt!</div>

The quizzes every week were sort of ridiculous and the lab can be boring if you've taken any other PSY lab before. It was well taught tho and you definitely learn a lot. The material can be sort of dry though...</div>

I know there's a lot of negative reviews of this course, but if you can take it with Prof. Lombrozo, DO IT. She's such a good professor and makes the topics engaging and easy to learn. It's a fair bit of memorization, but I found it really interesting anyways, and the tests weren't too hard. </div>

It seemed like most people in the class were taking it because it was a requirement for their major and I think in that case, it is manageable. But if you're taking the class out of interest, make sure you're expecting something explaining how mundane mental processes work. </div>

Lombrozo isn't the most engaging professor, the labs are a waste of time, and most people in the course are first years and sophomores so it's at a pretty basic level. Work load isn't bad though so that's a bonus</div>

I liked the readings, and besides the readings and lecture videos, the course load is very doable. you get weekly lab homework, but that was pretty easy. i would say that the midterm was hard because of the short time, but if you studied a lot beforehand it wasn't as stressful. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is one of the best classes I have taken online. The professor works really hard to provide structure and organization to the course that contributes to understanding and learning. I am a psych major studying more the social psych side, but I really respected and enjoyed this course. I learned a lot and would recommend as an STL to a student in any field.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">A lot of people said it was too much work? Not to be annoying but I really didn't think so and I was taking 4 other classes. It was like one textbook chapter + like 20 minutes of videos tops + a short Canvas quiz + sometimes a bs-able busy work assignment for lab graded for completion. Could do it across Monday + Tuesday afternoons, and the course schedule was very regular with few surprises. Final project was kind of a pain, especially given that we had to do like 3 separate write ups of it, but my lab instructor was very supportive and willing to help a lot with answering questions, and in my few interactions with Prof Lombrozo she was super kind and helpful too. Also interesting content, intersects with a lot of different fields, and not too hard to understand. I think it's a good class!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a super easy course if you've taken literally any psych course before now. I don't think I learned a single new concept taking this course. The readings aren't hard and the professor lays out the work for the week really well on the class canvas page. The tests are pretty hard but the other projects and weekly assignments are super easy. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This class can be deceptively hard and will require you to think critically about a lot of the topics being taught, but Professor Lombrozo is a great teacher.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Professor Lombrozo is an excellent professor and made the course very engaging. She brought great energy to class and explained concepts in a clear way. However, I did feel like it was a lot of work for an intro-level psych class and the lab seemed unnecessary. I would strongly recommend reaching out to others in your lab group/in class to form a study group for the midterm &amp; final, as I found it really helpful to work through the material with other students!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a fast-paced course, so make sure to stay on top of assignments and do all of the recommending readings. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you're confused about a topic; Professor Lombrozo is awesome at breaking down difficult concepts!</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Professor Lombrozo is an amazing instructor, and I would highly suggest this course if you are interested in cognitive psychology. Topics range from perception, attention, and memory all the way to categorization, language, decision-making, problem-solving, and visual imagery, which I found super interesting and applicable to both real life and other fields (such as philosophy, linguistics, and anthropology). This is a great STL, for the lab work is not overwhelming.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Loved this class. I didn't think I liked cognitive psych until I took this course. Professor Lombrozo is the BEST -- She is so organized, kind and willing to answer questions or discuss topics further than required. I definitely recommend taking this course if she is teaching it, but I would not take it without some kind of basic background in psychology. Otherwise, I think that you might find the content of lectures and the lab assignments a bit challenging. </div>
