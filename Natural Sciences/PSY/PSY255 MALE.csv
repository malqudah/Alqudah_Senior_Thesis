Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Really good introduction to psychology; basically an intro-level look of every other psychology lecture class available. If you're thinking about concentrating in psychology definitely take this as soon as possible,,
"Would not recommend unless you're a psych major, obviously - lecture slides are sub par and vague (he does this to encourage lecture attendance, but this only works if lectures are clear and substantive and engaging, which I found was not the case). Lab instructors seem to be a hit or miss in terms of quality, but the lab part is not too difficult.",,
I think the course was fair for what cognitive psychology is. Cog Psych is very different than the rest of the field so be prepared to be confused. Prof. Taylor is great at conveying his passion for the field and making the information understandable but he does go through the material very fast and there is a lot of information,,
"Note that I am a senior COS major who was taking this for distribution requirement, though I chose this for my STL out of general interest. Easy PDF, probably an easy A if you want that too. Like if you go to class, take notes, and review them after class, you'll learn everything quite easily. Prof Taylor is a good speaker, but the general impression is that lectures were hard to follow. I think it's just hard to take notes based on the slides themselves (they are mostly pictures) and since he just goes through the slides. Even when I tried to take notes, I wasn't really sure how to. It's hard to describe. Prof Taylor answered questions and was helpful though. The class in general covered topics pretty shallowly. I didn't attend any lectures, I got notes from a friend, I studied for 1 or 2 days before the midterm and final, and I expect to get around a B in the course (though I am pass/failing). I'm not sure if an intro cog psych class can not be shallow though. It just felt like a lot of memorization and very few concepts. Labs were pretty good. Andrew is a great preceptor. It's just that lots of the time, lab was just allocated time for us to think about how we'd do experiments or how to do work. I suppose it is just an intro to designing experiments for cog psych, in which case it does a good job.",,
n/a,,
"The fact that there are no textbooks, official lecture notes, or no list of what is exactly expected from you will make your life hard. It is too bad that a course on so interesting topics is quite unorganized.",,
"Not a heavy workload class, but kind of a drag.",,
"Don't take this unless you have other psychology background. It isn't an easy class. I think I did relatively well and if you're a psych major, you should do just fine. In fact, definitely take it because some of this material is vital for psych majors to know-- I mean cognitive psychology is the best.",,
pay attention in lecture,,
"Only take this course if you're a psych major doing it for the requirement. If someone other than Jordan Taylor is teaching it, perhaps it's worth a shot. The content is cool but the lectures are unclear and the labs often feel pointless. You get to run an experiment with a group, and running experiments is a fun thing! I love psych research! But this course times and organizes it really poorly. If I had taken this course before developing a liking for research, I worry that it would have deterred me.",,
"If you are taking this for the STL distribution, its really not worth it unless you PDF it",,
"Take as an STL is you plan to PDF. Midterm was actually hard. Don't do the readings, but make sure you know how to explain all the diagrams in lecture.",,
"This course is not hard, but it is hard to do well in. Lectures are somewhat hard to follow and studying for exams was quite difficult. Labs were fairly interesting and not too difficult.",,
"you don't need to thoroughly do the reasdings, but be sure to study in the material in detail bc some of the exam questions were pretty specific. also be sure you have a solid idea of the experiments are performed and the implications from them. for the final experiment, try to get a good group, ideally with people who know how to quickly do data anaylsis (that'll save you so much time) and don't pick a topic that's overly complicted.go to lecture and take thorough notes bc that's all you're going to have to study with, and try to get andrew as your lab ta - he's super cool",,
"If you are taking this for a distribution requirement, there are definitely much easier and more fulfilling courses out there. Other than the labs, the lectures had no substance and were filled with Jordan's stream of consciousness and unintelligible chatter! The final project did involve a decent amount of work, and you should make sure to start working on it as soon as possible.",,
"Definitely take. Super interesting material, manageable workload. Try to get in Andrew's precept.",,
"This class, while it did have a huge learning curve for me, was very rewarding in the end. The lectures are very fast-paced, so be prepared to take notes quickly in class, and fill in the gaps from the lectures later on in office hours or on your own (the lectures are posted online). The lab was great introductory lab course, where you learn a lot of basic lab skills, but I can imagine it might be a little tedious for more experienced students. Brandon was an incredible preceptor, and I liked scheduling time with him for questions outside of lab. Also, utilize the internet because I found the abstracts to a bunch of the experiments and models Professor Taylor presented in class to be super helpful when I was on my own.",,
"Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. Even if you are interested in the subject matter, read the other reviews which talk about the lecture style (very fast talking, no notes on the slides, and no textbook) and the labs, and seriously consider if you would enjoy this class in that context (most people I know did not).",,
This class is absolutely disgusting. Worst class ever. Professor Taylor has no idea what he is talking about; his lectures suck and are so disjointed and the lecture slides are probably even worse. I learned nothing new because it was just information from other PSY classes I have taken before--it should not be a requirement for the PSY major.,,
Labs and Lectures are not connected so be prepared to learn a lot!   I really enjoyed the final project of the lab.  Lecture moves very quickly and can be hard to follow,,
"The lectures are great, but the lab section is kinda a lot. It can serve as a more interesting and applicable STL for humanities/social sciences people.",,
"Took it for an STL.   Interesting material, but lots of it.  Tough to delineate what is important and what is not.  Jordan is engaging and knows his stuff, probably even your name too.  You can entirely ignore the readings, lectures are a must, and labs are applicable and easy...though at times can be a drag.  A good class!",,
"This course covers a lot of material very quickly which allows you to touch on a lot of concepts. The class is not too difficult if you make an effort to review the material weekly because you may find yourself rushing at the end otherwise. Also, the pace can speed up towards the end with the final assignment so preparing early can save you some stress. Overall, a great class to get an overview of psychology and find what you might be interested in.",,
"Professor Taylor is passionate about his work, but can be a confusing lecturer. I personally struggled with this class, but not everyone did. The midterm is the only grade you really have to evaluate your progress throughout the semester, so that's tough. Take this class if you find cognitive psychology to be generally interesting.",,
very difficult for an entry level course. it has no prereqs so I assumed it would be baseline but is actually super difficult.,,
"pick another STL for your mental sanity, unless you're a psychology major, then embrace the grind.",,
"Departmental if psych majors, but I would not recommend for STL. Poorly taught",,
"Ask a lot of questions in lecture instead of pretending to understand the material. People will be afraid to raise their hands but it is essential for everyone in the class for those few brave people to ask. I wasn't one of them, but I applaud those who were...",,
"Lectures are hard to understand at times due to lack of structure within each week's topics, no textbook either, but would recommend regardless if you're interested in the content!",,
"While this class covers some very interesting areas in the field of cognitive psychology, Professor Taylor's teaching style was very vague and hard to follow. Also, the weekly readings were very long and dense, and the takeaways from them were rarely clear. I would advise against taking this course.",,
Take only if necessary,,
I? would not recommend this course unless you need it for a departmental. I? found that I? had to teach myself a lot of the material from lectures and the labs tended to be a bit boring.,,
