Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Do not take it. I took it to try to see if I was interested in psychology and I just feel like I've wasted my time because I learned too little to decide if I really like psychology. It's all based on the textbook, and nothing goes into enough detail to feel real and engaging. Take a more specific class instead.",,
I definitely recommend for students to take this as their first course in psychology. The professor is wonderful and very helpful! The class is a perfect size and the lab assignments are not too bad.,,
"If you are taking this course to fulfill the lab requirement, there are other psych and lab courses that are more engaging and interesting that can fulfill the requirement. This course provided a good introduction to the science of psychology, but you may already know much of the material. Don't take this course expecting to have your mind blown. Study early in order to do well on the midterms, which are cumulative. Professor Pronin is also a bit inflexible, so do the best you can to stay on top of course materials. Overall, this course won't blow your mind, but the lectures are engaging enough. A good course to take with friends in order to have a study group for exams.",,
"This is an easy A course as long as you do the textbook readings, focus in lab and submit quality lab reports, and study for exams. Exams require a good working knowledge of the textbook readings. It is an interesting intro course and a good way to get your SEL requirement out of the way. I would recommend taking it!",,
"A great option for an SEL: not too difficult, great professor, reasonable amount of work, and an interesting lab. Take it!",,
Go to lecture and ask questions,,
"Don't take this course. The exams are entirely textbook memorization despite the labs and lectures covering barely any material. The final was updated from a three hour final to an EIGHT hour final. This was cruel in light of covid, and you would think a psychology class would understand the detriments of prolonged and undue stress. Don't take this class. Can't PDF. Not worth the work. The assigned work isn't a lot but the readings are a lot, and in order to do well, you will have to understand the entire textbook. Very unreasonable course.",,
"This course is introductory, so don't expect to delve too deeply into each topic. Therefore, you cover a lot of material very briefly. Make sure to attend lectures or at least review lecture slides (which Professor Pronin uploads before each lecture). Exams are difficult but fair, and they test obscure details from the textbook, so make sure you understand all concepts discussed in textbooks, even if you don't discuss them in lecture (professor emphasizes this). Labs are long and we only focused on three topics the entire semester; however, lab reports are straightforward and the material isn't boring. Overall, make sure you understand material from both lecture and textbooks, study for exams (make a lecture review and take notes while reading the textbook), and you should do pretty well.",,
Great lab class if you're looking for one. Pretty broad.,,
"I don't recommend this course. The lab work is unfulfilling and very repetitive. The textbook reading is very dry, but you have to memorize its information to do well in the exams. Definitely don't take this course if you're doing it for the pre-med prerequisite. If you're taking this because you need an SEL, just take MOL 101 instead.",,
Take this to fulfill the science with lab requirement. The lectures weren't too bad. Get Logan as a lab TA if possible! She will make your life easier. The only annoying thing is the fact that we have to study the slides AND book which had like 50 pages for 1 chapter.,,
"If you do the textbook readings, the content of this class is largely intuitive, and you can relax but still learn a lot.",,
"Take for a relatively chill SEL, but be warned that you can't PDF the class and a majority of your grade rests on tests that rely entirely on memorization of the textbook.",,
"lectures do not give you all the information, so do the readings",,
Do the readings and attend lecture,,
"This is a great course for the ""science with lab"" requirement -- two interesting lectures and some reading in the textbook each week. The professor is a great lecturer and very nice. Labs are a little boring, but not difficult.",,
"If you are looking to fulfill your lab requirement, this course is a solid choice. While not incredibly interesting, as is typical of an introductory course, it is often genuinely thought provoking and a good way to become familiar with psychology.",,
"Solid SEL distribution requirement class and it's not too bad as a fifth class. Do note you canNOT PDF this class although it's not too bad to get an A-/A if you put in the studying. Do note that the exams are somewhat arbitrary and that you absolutely need to spend more time studying the textbook than the slides; exams are multiple choice but there are sometimes arbitrary questions that are not about the concepts and are about obscure dates/people. Still, Professor Pronin is a pretty good lecturer and I certainly found the class interesting enough.",,
"If you are interested in exploring the fields of psychology and/or neuroscience, there is no better place to start than with this class. Emily is a fantastic lecturer and you will get a good idea of whether or not you might enjoy this discipline. Overall, a very fairly graded class and an extremely easy PDF if needed.",,
"I enjoyed this class. Lecture is interesting and Prof Pronin is an engaging lecturer, but the exams rely very little on what is done in lecture. Basically read the textbook chapters in and out to do well on the exams. Labs are also relatively straight forward and easy, just give yourself some time to do them. If you have Yeji as a lab instructor, she is great - I would recommend her. Overall, this class is relatively easy though and I would recommend it if you need the distribution requirement.",,
Super easy and interesting way to fulfill a lab requirement. Would definitely recommend,,
"Easy fifth/SEL if you're good at memorization. Some lectures were more interesting than others, but all the material was well taught. Labs really weren't fun though.",,
Easiest lab course in the game.,,
"Definitely take this course if you need a lab requirement. The labs are pretty interesting and not too difficult. Read the textbook before the exams, there's a good amount of info in the textbook that's not in lecture",,
The course is nothing special...I have nothing against it but I am not in love with how much I've learned.,,
This class is a really great intro course if you are interested in psych. The labs are really straightforward and don't take too much time. The exams can be a little random but if you make sure to read or even skim the textbook you should be ok.,,
"Not a great course. If you're genuinely and extremely interested in psychology, then sure. Take it. But if you just want an easy A and the SEL requirement, I would look elsewhere. Honestly not worth it. Class is disorganized and I didn't find the lectures that interesting. Labs were just doing spreadsheets for three hours. It's not hard work, but it's annoying.",,
"The lab is not really connected to the course, do the textbook readings because exams are very specific",,
"The course is just fine. Take it as an easy fifth and/or SEL if you need it. The only thing is, some exam questions asked specifically about the textbook so make sure you do the readings rather than just going to lectures.",,
"You should take this course! It's absolutely necessary if becoming a PSY major, but also is a fantastic SEL for non-STEM kids. Knowing psychology is such a great skill to have, and this course teaches you all the basics. The lectures are pretty enjoyable, the work is manageable, and the labs are fantastic!",,
This is a fine class to take for your lab requirement. Lectures are interesting but labs do get boring.,,
I think if you're looking for something to fulfill the Science with Lab requirement this is one of the best options. Even though you can't PDF the material is reasonable and fairly engaging and the labs are pretty fun sometimes.,,
"If you need an SEL and are a Humanities/Social Sciences major with any interest in psychology, I strongly recommend this course!",,
"Make sure to keep up with the readings and ask for clarification if any questions arise. Also, ask to see mistakes from your exams, in order to make sure that those missed concepts stick.",,
"Do the readings and show uo to class, and you shouldn't have many problems.",,
Take dev psych instead,,
Very straightforward course if you want a science lab distributional. Professor Pronin is a great lecturer and none of the material is that complex. Labs are mostly busywork. Do the readings in the textbook; the exams draw on them as well as on the lecture material.,,
N/A,,
"I enjoyed taking this course! My only previous experience in learning psychology was AP Psychology, but I was able to follow along and learn much from this course even with my minimal experience. The readings were manageable and the lab assignments were graded leniently for the most part. Lectures were engaging, as the professor made efforts to interact with the students, asked stimulating questions, and was open to answering any student questions. To be successful in this class, make sure to do all of the readings! As for the lecture notes, the professor posted lecture slide handouts to Canvas before every lecture, which made the note-taking process very convenient.",,
If you are taking this to fulfill a prereq take another PDF class (you cannot PDF this one). The exams are multiple choice based and require lots of bland textbook memorization. Lecture are interesting nevertheless.,,
Do readings before class; take notes on them and then just integrate your lecture notes into your reading notes.It is not difficult to perform well on lab reports; just follow the instructions carefully.,,
