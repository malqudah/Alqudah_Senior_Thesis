Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Go to lectures -- the specific material taught in class (often not in the textbook) is important and comes up often on the midterm and final! Also make sure to read the textbook for the midterm and final. And put your best effort into your lab reports -- they are a big percentage of your grade!!,,
be prepared for a lot of reading.,,
Do not take for STL. There are better classes to take.,,
Take the course if you really love psychology! It requires a lot of time outside of class because exams were mostly based off of readings from the textbook.,,
"Just memorize the readings and definitely go to office hours to make sure you're doing the lab correctly. If you want to fulfill an STL, there are definitely easier classes out there.",,
"This class is really not that much work except during exam weeks. You only really have to write a lab write-up each week, which gets pretty easy, but then when exams roll around, you have to study so much information that it can appear overwhelming. I know some people who had AP Psych backgrounds who even found studying everything challenging, but I had absolutely no experience and was able to study hard enough to do well on the exams. Joel Cooper is an AWESOME lecturer. I loved coming to class to hear him speak! The labs are kind of pointless, but not insufferable.",,
"I would say keep up with the readings but considering I didnt open the textbook until the week before the midterm and during winter break, when you do read the textbook, make flashcards or quizlets to learn concepts. the course is mainly memorization based",,
"The class is a great introduction to the subject, if you have taken psych before maybe dont take it because it is a survey of all the facets of the subject. I enjoyed the lectures and the lab was not complicated but slightly random.",,
Be careful because you can't pdf this class but it is super interesting and a good intro to psychology.,,
I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in psychology but has never really taken it before. this course will help you understand if you are interested in psychology major and psychology overall.,,
"This is a great option for an STL requirement, but is definitely difficult without any background knowledge in psychology.",,
I'd definitely recommend this class for an STL. The labs are long but all of the assignments are very doable and lectures and readings were actually quite interesting.,,
KEEP UP WITH THE READING.,,
Read the textbook and memorize the key terms.,,
Take this course! The lectures were so awesome and I learned so much,,
"I enjoyed the class, and the material is interesting; however, the labs are difficult to get through.",,
"To ask for help on the lab homework from the preceptor, as well as do the readings from the textbook.",,
"If you have the ability, I would definitely recommend taking this course. It's not only a useful one to fulfill requirements, but Cooper and the lab instructors make it a great experience. Lectures, although repetitive at times if you do notes, can bring laughs and energy from Cooper. Labs are not overly complicated and even have some fun aspects in the testing and games. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an STL with a non-stem base.",,
Take it. It's a cool class,,
Go to class and apply yourself.,,
LOVE THIS COURSE! Do the reading and look at the lectures and it is not too bad.,,
"The lab isn't too hard, so I would recommend it if you need a lab and the material is interesting.  Very information-heavy exams, though.",,
"This is a pretty straightforward introduction to psychology. It isn't too much work I don't think, and Professor Cooper is a very engaging lecturer that seems to have a lot of knowledge. I would recommend this course to fulfill your lab requirement.",,
"I would definitely recommend this course for non-STEM majors looking for an STL. Despite the heavy reading load and huge amount of content, it is very engaging and interesting.",,
Somewhat a self taught course but easier lab requirement,,
"If you take this course, DO THE DAILY READINGS! I didn't study at all until 3 days before the midterm, I feel that I could have enjoyed the course even more if I read weekly. These are interesting topics and are worth reading.",,
Start reading early and take notes on the chapters. Attend lectures bc it ends up on the midterm,,
Take it. I now know that I do not want to do psychology but I still enjoyed the course.,,
It's basically exactly like AP Psych. Literally identical.,,
I would advise students to take this class if they would like a broad overview of psychology.,,
Decent STL... made me sure I didn't want to major in Psych however. Workload was manageable and I should be doing better in the class. Wish there was more clarity as to what material is important and what isn't. Was super interested in sleep / dreams but that was cut at the end of the course since we ran out of time... too bad.,,
"If you are interested in psychology and are willing to put a lot into this course, you will get a lot out of it. Be willing to spend a lot of energy and attention on the lab and assignments.",,
Take it if you have interest! Learned a ton and not a difficult lab.,,
Professor Cooper was very engaging and funny. He goes off on tangents so you really have to do the reading. Tests are pretty much just memorization and material can be dry. Labs are fun and very interesting though! I would definetly recommend taking this class for the STL. Very easy way to get a lab credit.,,
Go to lecture and take detaild notes.,,
"Prioritize the content that was covered in lecture when studying for the tests, and study hard! The labs can be challenging, but the lab instructors are available to help you. Professor Cooper is a great lecturer, I found all of his lectures very entertaining.",,
Take notes when doing the readings,,
"The exams require a lot of memorization, so I would recommend periodically reviewing textbook chapters throughout the semester to keep the information fresh. Labs are not tested on the exams, but they're 40% of your grade and can definitely be a good boost. You can often get the lab homework done in class which is nice. Abla is a beast!! Professor Cooper is also a really good lecturer and just the cutest person. I would gladly take a class from him again!!",,
