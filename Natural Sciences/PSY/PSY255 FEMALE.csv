Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
quite boring course; not an easy STL; go elsewhere if you need a distribution requirement,,
"Prof. Lombrozo is amazing! Her lectures for this course were super interesting, and she is incredibly kind. Instead of making students sit through two fifty minute zoom lectures, she made the decision to switch to just one synchronous lecture with shorter asychronous lecture videos. This was a really good move and I think this class worked really well in the format she chose. She is also very organized and upfront with her expectations, which made doing every assignment much easier. She responds quickly to emails and is very helpful. Partway through the course, she sent out a survey about the way she's running the course, and she took the time afterward to talk through the responses she got and how she would address our concerns. As far as labs are concerned, they were kind of long for the content we went over in them (they were  very similar to the Social Psychology labs, with QALMRI and final project preparation, but the Social Psychology labs are 50 minutes whereas the labs in this class were 3 hours). It does count as a lab credit though. Also, Kerem made labs super fun!! He really made an effort to get to know everyone in his labs, and he was always ready to help out if we had any problems understanding the content. He is also very funny, which is good in a teacher you are spending three hours per week with. Overall, this course was really really great!",,
"Take this course! Professor Lombrozo is great and really wants students to understand the material, and it shows in her enthusiasm when teaching. Other than that, readings are reasonable, lectures are fun and informative, and exams being open-note doesn't hurt!",,
Very well taught. Interesting. You will definitely come out of this class having learnt something you didn't know. Highly recommend.,,
"There is a lot of reading, but it is important to do. This class will be more fun in-person, and you will learn a lot of cool things on cognitive processes.",,
"As a student considering a PSY major, I would definitely recommend taking this course as an intro PSY course. I learned so much from Professor Lombrozo and from the labs about experimental design and the intricacies of conducting science.",,
dont take it unless you have to or are very interested,,
Professor Lombrozo is amazing. Make flashcards to study for exams!,,
This class is a lot more work than it needs to be frankly. The quizzes every week were sort of ridiculous and the lab can be boring if you've taken any other PSY lab before. It was well taught tho and you definitely learn a lot. The material can be sort of dry though...,,
"Interesting course and very well-run. It is a decent amount of work though, so keep that in mind.",,
"decently easy class and very interesting! lectures were great, readings were interesting, labs were kind of painful, tests were very fair, and the final project really isn't much work since you're forced to spread the work across the last month or so of the semester in lab. overall would recommend for anyone interested, but would advise getting a lab that isn't at night since you might fall asleep out of boredom",,
"(I took this online so take this with a grain of salt.) I know there's a lot of negative reviews of this course, but if you can take it with Prof. Lombrozo, DO IT. She's such a good professor and makes the topics engaging and easy to learn. It's a fair bit of memorization, but I found it really interesting anyways, and the tests weren't too hard.",,
Don't take this course unless absolutely neccesary,,
"It wasn't a horrible class but I would recommend trying a different psych class. It seemed like most people in the class were taking it because it was a requirement for their major and I think in that case, it is manageable. But if you're taking the class out of interest, make sure you're expecting something explaining how mundane mental processes work.",,
"Remember that Cogpsych is the study of like the software of the brain. So the same way there's hardware and software to a computer, there's hardware and software to the brain. Until you approach everything with the approach of ""I'm studying the software of the brain"" you will be very very lost.",,
"Honestly, its a good class, but not super interesting unless you are a big cognitive science fan. Take it if you need a distribution requirement, but its not the most fun class out there.",,
Graded fairly - take good notes.,,
PLEASE MANAGE YOUR TIME AND DONT TAKE 2 PSY COURSES AT ONCE. The workload for lab is already equivalent to that of another class.,,
Take this course! You learn so much interesting material that we apparently use everyday.,,
Decent departmental.,,
"If you don't have to take this course, I don't know why you would. Lombrozo isn't the most engaging professor, the labs are a waste of time, and most people in the course are first years and sophomores so it's at a pretty basic level. Work load isn't bad though so that's a bonus",,
"this class is interesting! I liked the readings, and besides the readings and lecture videos, the course load is very doable. you get weekly lab homework, but that was pretty easy. i would say that the midterm was hard because of the short time, but if you studied a lot beforehand it wasn't as stressful.",,
"This is one of the best classes I have taken online. The professor works really hard to provide structure and organization to the course that contributes to understanding and learning. I am a psych major studying more the social psych side, but I really respected and enjoyed this course. I learned a lot and would recommend as an STL to a student in any field.",,
"A lot of people said it was too much work? Not to be annoying but I really didn't think so and I was taking 4 other classes. It was like one textbook chapter + like 20 minutes of videos tops + a short Canvas quiz + sometimes a bs-able busy work assignment for lab graded for completion. Could do it across Monday + Tuesday afternoons, and the course schedule was very regular with few surprises. Final project was kind of a pain, especially given that we had to do like 3 separate write ups of it, but my lab instructor was very supportive and willing to help a lot with answering questions, and in my few interactions with Prof Lombrozo she was super kind and helpful too. Also interesting content, intersects with a lot of different fields, and not too hard to understand. I think it's a good class!",,
This is a super easy course if you've taken literally any psych course before now. I don't think I learned a single new concept taking this course. The readings aren't hard and the professor lays out the work for the week really well on the class canvas page. The tests are pretty hard but the other projects and weekly assignments are super easy.,,
"This class can be deceptively hard and will require you to think critically about a lot of the topics being taught, but Professor Lombrozo is a great teacher.",,
"Professor Lombrozo is an excellent professor and made the course very engaging. She brought great energy to class and explained concepts in a clear way. However, I did feel like it was a lot of work for an intro-level psych class and the lab seemed unnecessary. I would strongly recommend reaching out to others in your lab group/in class to form a study group for the midterm & final, as I found it really helpful to work through the material with other students!",,
"This is a fast-paced course, so make sure to stay on top of assignments and do all of the recommending readings. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you're confused about a topic; Professor Lombrozo is awesome at breaking down difficult concepts!",,
The textbook readings are helpful.,,
do textbook readings and take notes in lecture,,
Only Prof. Lombrozo can make a virtual lecture course as engaging as it was,,
"This course is not too much work, but definitely keep up on the reading. Take it if you are very interested in psychology, but if you are looking for a course just because you are interested/curious about in psych, I would probably recommend social psych instead.",,
Busy daily work. Graded a little arbitrarily and subjectively. Interesting though.,,
"Professor Lombrozo is an amazing instructor, and I would highly suggest this course if you are interested in cognitive psychology. Topics range from perception, attention, and memory all the way to categorization, language, decision-making, problem-solving, and visual imagery, which I found super interesting and applicable to both real life and other fields (such as philosophy, linguistics, and anthropology). This is a great STL, for the lab work is not overwhelming.",,
"Loved this class. I didn't think I liked cognitive psych until I took this course. Professor Lombrozo is the BEST -- She is so organized, kind and willing to answer questions or discuss topics further than required. I definitely recommend taking this course if she is teaching it, but I would not take it without some kind of basic background in psychology. Otherwise, I think that you might find the content of lectures and the lab assignments a bit challenging.",,
