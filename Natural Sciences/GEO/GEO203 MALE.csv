Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This is a pretty good class and isn't too much work. I just took it since I had a general interest in mountains, caves, and such, and I found the course material pretty interesting.",,
Very interesting course to take regardless of major. Very fun and light class that teaches very important aspects of geology. Great teaching staff.,,
"This class is a fantastic experience if you're PDFing it. If you're taking it for a grade though, be warned - the grading can be inconsistent and difficult to navigate. Content-wise, this class is great, and Laurel and the preceptors make it a decent experience. Ian is an absolute legend",,
"Workload is manageable, with a weekly PSet and some light to moderate textbook reading. The content of the exams seems to be a little bit specific, so take good notes on the reading and come to class prepared with questions.",,
"Some parts of this class are extremely cool! The problem sets are interesting and walk you through problem-solving like a geologist in really neat ways. They gave me some sweet kmz files that I love to mess around with. Ian Ocampo was also a great preceptor!But we were also taught a lot of stuff which seemed to pertain more to Prof. Buynevich's area of study than to what you'd expect from an often-required geology class. Similarly, you can zone out for ten minutes during a lecture and miss nothing, but then miss one minute with all of the substantive information.Even though you can develop an intuitive understanding for a lot of the content, at the end of the day you'll need MEMORIZATION to succeed. Expect exams to pull seemingly random questions based off of one section of a lecture where you couldn't tell if it was important information or one of the professor's tangents. I might have enjoyed this class a lot more with another professor.",,
"This class was pretty disorganized and it seemed like the professors were always trying to get on the same page with presenting the material, though I think it might be because there was a visiting professor and they were trying to work out the kinks. It's not a difficult class and there's not a lot of work but it wasn't the most interesting topic.",,
"I loved this class. Ilya and Laurel did an awesome job at making the course material understandable regardless of your academic background. Problem sets aren't too bad, and the precepts usually go over how to do the trickiest parts of the upcoming homework.",,
"Pretty decent basic geology course, although the grading can feel somewhat arbitrary. Ilya is interesting to listen to but he often goes on tangents in the middle of lecture, so just keep an ear out for what's important and what's not. Do be careful though, because sometimes those tangents do end up being important (read: on the midterm).",,
"This course is very disorganized and the content is unnecessarily difficult to understand because of the way it is presented in lectures. There also isn't a textbook or anything so there really isn't a streamlined source of material. I found the second half of the course to be much better than the first half, but I'm really glad I got to take this during an online semester so I could speed up the lectures.",,
"Engineers who like consistency in class structure and readings will absolutely hate this course.  Solid earth science is very very interesting material, but just so poorly organized as a curriculum.",,
"I highly discourage against taking this class. Lectures are very dry and unclear as the professor has slides that he doesn't introduce until the end of class and spends the first 70 minutes drawing figures that can be very confusing and easy to get lost with. That being said, if you do not understand the material there is no textbook in the second half of the course to teach you. So the only material you can learn from is lectures, which are hard to follow, and pre-lecture assignments (reading followed by questions), which were very tedious. Precepts were very helpful though.Midterm and final were also very unfair and I believe I am someone who actually paid attention in class and studied well. The midterm and final are multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short answer. A majority of the questions are not theory based but questions from side tangents or stories the professor told. So to get those questions right you had to be listening during lecture with every last brain cell. Also, the tests asked loosely structured questions looking for specific answers. So if you did not answer exactly right, there was no partial credit. Even better, there was no review session for the midterm or final, so to prepare you were told that everything after the final would be on it (super helpful!).Maybe in a few months from now I will see the value in taking this class, but especially over zoom, this course was not worth the time and stress. If you are required to take this for a department, don't, take an alternative.",,
"Great intro Geo course, and very accessible! Would recommend if you want to learn more about Earth, its history and the interconnected nature of processes that shape our environment. With Ilya its important to take good notes and listen closely to lectures as exams might ask a lot of trivia-like questions, but otherwise not too challenging.",,
enjoyed this class more than I thought i would!,,
"take if you have to, laurel is great!",,
"If its a requirement for you as an environmental or geo major, take it earlier in your academic career. Covers a lot of introductory material on a superficial level, which is kind of dissatisfying. Fine as an intro course, but if you've already taken some more advanced geo classes, can be pretty boring. Not terrible course, but hard to figure out what material is important and what's anecdotal.",,
