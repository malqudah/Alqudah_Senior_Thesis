Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"If you are considering majoring in Geosciences, take this course. It introduces you to the field thoroughly. Professor Irving is good and the field trip is fun and helpful for applying what you learn in the class to the real world.",,
not a lot of work. Very interesting. Come to class and you'll be set.,,
"Definitely recommend. It is arguably not difficult if you are willing to put in the modest time to understand the material. Help is always available if youre struggling or behind. I absolutely loved the class, favorite class by far as of right now.",,
"Puts the 'fun' in fundamentals of solid earth science!, and takes you on a fun trip to Pennsylvania in October. Many CEE majors taking it won't be having a super fun time, but that it because they might have a closed mindset about the course. I took this as an intro GEO course because I want to major in GEO, and really enjoyed the lectures.",,
"Do not take this class unless you have to. There are better GEO classes. The Psets are long and feel like busy work. I did not feel like I took much away from this class. There was a good deal of memorization, and not enough big picture understanding.",,
"This class is good to see if you are actually interested in the Geoscience department. If there are some low marks, it could be the some CEE folks being a bit annoyed, but good for geoscience.",,
"Personally I greatly enjoyed this course: the field trips and psets are a great way to explore the content in more depth, but the tests rarely ask anything as difficult as the psets. Admittedly the material is very disorganized, but overall I learned a lot of interesting info.",,
"If you are interested in solid earth science, take this class! It is a good introduction to solid earth science's various subfields, which is helpful if you're a prospective GEO major.",,
It was a good introductory class that I learned a lot from. The only thing I had against the class was the field trips. They were both a huge waste of time,,
"Unless you absolutely have to, do not take this class. If you do choose to take it, absolutely go to precepts, and prepare to do a lot of self teaching.",,
