Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Extremely easy as a PDF. Really no reason not to take the class if looking for an easy PDF. They give the answers to the homework out during precept and nothing in lecture is ever tested on. Take it! Kinda stressful tho if not PDFing cuz a decent amount of assignments,,
Make sure to attend lectures for the quizzes and you will be fine,,
Do not take this class. Not a good SPIA core and genuinely would advise against doing GHP because of this core.,,
"This class felt so disorganized. There were so many random quizzes, sometimes two a week, and it honestly didn't feel like I was learning anything.",,
Go to precepts! They are so important for understanding the concepts and asking questions about course material.,,
Prof. Rice is an excellent professor! It is clear that he really loves the subject and makes a great effort to teach us about epidemiology,,
"This course is so easy that it might be tempting to skip lectures ? however, I would recommend still going because it's sometimes still interesting. Also, the content from textbook readings are pretty much covered entirely in lecture, so they're not necessary at all (although the textbook is super well written). Overall, I didn't learn much from this course, but it did give me some new insight into disease dynamics and epidemiological vocabulary.",,
Not a bad course - manageable workload. Instructors were very passionate.,,
Only take it if you have to fulfill the GHP certificate. There are better courses out there,,
"Good course for the SPIA requirement, lectures a bit boring but manageable as a whole",,
"Definitely a hard subject to grasp, but Prof. Rice does a great job of making it understandable!",,
Interesting material but not great lectures.,,
"This is honestly one of the worst classes I've taken at Princeton. While the topic of this class may lend itself to be more dry material, there were many more ways to make this class more interesting and engaging. Instead, I found the lectures incredibly boring and not presenting much new material. There were also too many guest lectures for this short of a semester. The class seems quite easy, as all the problem sets and quizzes are graded on completion, but the midterm was arbitrarily graded and I have a sense the final projects will be too. This was his first year teaching the class, so hopefully some of the kinks will be worked out for next year.",,
na,,
I would recommend this class.  It was pretty boring because you kind of already know the info they teach cuz it is pretty self-explanatory.  But i enjoyed the debates we had and some of the discussions.  Definitely glad I took it cuz i think it was easy.  Wish lectures were a bit more interesting or interactive,,
It is interesting but not as good of a class as GHP350. Take it with a grain of salt that the grading is kinda wacky and assignments are harder than lectures. Super interesting material though!,,
"With all due respect, this was the biggest joke of a class I have ever seen. 4 psets that were done in precept with the class and were only graded for completion, 2 ""in-class debates"" that were each 10% of the grade and literally only required attendance, 10% midterm that was take home, open book and 1 week long, ... Take this class if you want to waste your time or you are a SPIA major looking for a very easy distribution requirement. Prof. Rice is an amazing person and he is incredibly interested in the field so if you have a genuine interest in the topic and do the readings you will probably learn something. If you need ""external motivation"" then you wont really take anything from this class.",,
"If Professor Rice is teaching this course, take it! This was a wonderful EEB departmental, and Professor Rice's teaching was engaging, interesting and also entertaining.",,
"The content/teaching is a bit all over the place, but the assignments are very manageable and Prof. Rice is super super accommodating regarding extensions/needing additional help.",,
"not a dealbreaker for GHP, but a bit boring sometimes. Diogo and prof rice were really nice and helpful but sometimes a bit unresponsive",,
"This course was much better than I expected from previous reviews. It was detailed and well-organized. The lectures were usually very interesting. There were a lot  of  assignments but most  of them were taken for completion. However, for the assignments  that were graded, the grading was pretty arbitrary and inconsistent. I learned a lot about what epidemiology is, but  I  would  say it wasn't the most fascinating subject  to study for  me personally",,
"You're probably taking this as part of the GHP certificate. It's not too bad, the workload is reasonable and grading seems fair. Professor and preceptors care about us a lot, and material is interesting for the most part. It can be a bit dry at times but I thought the class was very well organized.",,
"This was not the most engaging course, but to get the SPIA science policy departmental done, this did the job. Professor Rice was a bit difficult to work with and not the most accommodating, but Liana (preceptor) was great.",,
"Good course, chill and fairly graded. I didn't take that much out of it but all the professors were nice and helpful.",,
"I would recommend showing up to lecture and going to office hours if you need it, especially before any paper assignments.",,
"This course is solid - not thrilling, not horrible, not impossible.",,
