Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Only take this class if you have to.,,
The midterm isn't bad if you are solid on the concepts and calculations from the semester. Do the p-sets and utilize your time in precept to nail these concepts down. Lectures are interesting and will challenge you to think.,,
"Stay organized while taking the course, as there is a lot of information to learn. Also, stay on top of the readings. They're very helpful in doing well.",,
It is a great course to take if you are interested in infectious disease and or just have general curiosity of outbreaks. I strongly recommend this course to anyone with these interests.,,
"It makes sense that this is a part of the GHP certificate, but I do not think I would do the GHP certificate solely because of this class. What you need to know about Epidemiology it teaches well, but more time is dedicated on superficial surveys and conversations that you miss within the large lecture format.",,
"This class is a fine course. I am still mad about the way grading was handled during the COVID-crisis (switched from mandatory PDF to optional after the term ended). If you're GHP, take it.",,
"You don't need to do the readings, but study hard for the midterm and keep up with the work throughout the semester.",,
"Take it if you're interested in epidemiology or if it's required, obviously -- but I have to say it is more of a comprehensive introduction to the field rather than a specialized, math/stats-heavy course on epidemiology.",,
"Do not take it if Metcalf is teaching. She never responds to emails and evidently doesn't care about students. The course is the most unstructured and disorganized one that I have taken here so far. Practice midterm exams had wrong answers and didn't even cover midterm material. Even before Covid, Metcalf would often miss lecture and give the preceptors busy work to give us. Try to get Joel as a preceptor, he is great.",,
Keep up with readings and lectures to be ready for the midterm. Attend lectures as there might be group activities every now and then for participation!,,
This class is great if you are interested in global health but also like science/math because this course is definitely more concrete than GHP 350. Definitely try to consult the textbook about key terms ahead of lecture so that things make more sense as you go. And don't be afraid to reach out to the preceptors and professor about what they are expecting on your assignments so you can do really well.,,
Relevant now more than ever,,
"Easy core course for GHP, Metcalf is great and really kind",,
"This is an excellent course. Really interesting, especially this semester in light of the pandemic. It just shows how important this subject is. Professor Metcalf is one of my favorite professors! She is so kind and great with questions about her research or epidemiology in general. She does a great job teaching this class and is very fair in assessments. One of my favorite classes.",,
I recommend this course if you need it for the GHP program. It's also very interesting if you are interested in epidemiology/public health! Make sure to go to office hours and ask questions.,,
"Solid! Having the ability to receive some early insight/warnings about COVID-19 as they were unfolding was definitely a valuable experience to have as a premedical student. I'm grateful for the perspective that we were able to get Professor Metcalf on the matter, and I think it helped me process and rationalize the importance of the social distancing measures that were not being taken seriously at first. I can only imagine how the course will incorporate insight from COVID-19 over the course of the next year.",,
"Not sure how things would have looked without corona, but I overall enjoyed this course.  Professor Metcalf is super sweet and smart and her lectures are very engaging and interesting.  Joel was a great preceptor and the workload was relatively light.  The midterm was definitely tougher than expected so make sure to take good notes throughout the semester.  Not having a final is great though.",,
"good course! Can be sometimes dry or repetitive, but it's a good complementary class to GHP 350 because of its more scientific/evidence-based approach. exams and psets are pretty fair!",,
This class was so great to be taking during the pandemic. I wonder if all the seats will fill up now... really important to learn about now!,,
"If you like penguin sweaters and lectures that are a waste of time, this is the course for you!!!! However, if you have to take this class but aren?t a fan of penguins, you?re in for some bad news because jess metcalf wears THE SAME PENGUIN SWEATER LITERALLY EVERY WEEK. ITS WILD. But real talk, this course is an L. It?s easy, but it?s an L. Lectures are boring and dry and are unrelated to assignments. If you?re taking this, you probably have to and you know what? It?s okay because it?s not stressful at all, it?s just mind-numbingly mind-numbing. And lowkey that?s fine! Because you can always take more interesting courses during the semester!",,
"Some of the problem sets will have confusing wording and unfortunately sometimes even when you spend time completing them you may not get the check plus you want.  Do not worry too much since their percentage is pretty small, focus on the papers you do towards the end of the class.  Midterm is long and requires your understanding of problem solving and providing explanations but if you review problem sets and lecture notes you will be okay.  Prof. Metcalf is amazingly kind and understanding so reach out to her whenever you need.",,
"This class is interesting and not too difficult. I would recommend taking it. Be sure to take the midterm seriously. It is not difficult, but it counts for a large percentage of your grade and is easy to mess up. Practice short and concise answers, and timing how quickly you can identify and evaluate each question.",,
