Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This is a doable ""just a QR"" class (but there definitely are easier options out there). You will get the most out of this course if you take it your first or second year at Princeton, for it is easier when you still remember high school math material. Nonetheless, the instructors genuinely want you to succeed so take the course if you are interested in doing college math!",,
"Prof. Murayama is amazing. So incredibly responsive, accommodating, and dedicated to your success. Boya is wonderful as well. Great class.",,
Takumi is the perfect maths teacher. If you can take this with Takumi then I promise you can get through it.,,
TAKE THIS CLASS. Super simple and easy if you just pay attention. Professors are always there if you need help,,
