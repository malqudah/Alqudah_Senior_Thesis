Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Prof. Sly can be fast in explaining things at times, so don't be afraid to stop him when he writes something down without explaining it. Even though they are not required both for class and for psets, be sure to watch the first supplementary videos about \sigma-algebra and Caratheodory's extension theorem, or else you will be lost. Probability is based on measure theory and this course puts most of the measure theory staff in supplementary videos, which are not required. Sometimes the explanations get not too rigorous such as explaining generated \sigma-algebras as information about random variables, and during the latter half of the course we never really used sigma algebras in proofs but only treated them as information. So if you are really looking for a proof rigorous class that really delves into measure theory, take the graduate ORF 526 instead. If you are only learning probability as preparing to work in eco or cos, take orfe 309 as this class is proof based, not calculation based. Although officially said to use Sinai and cover chapter 1-10, it actually follows Durrett most of the time, (which has less measure theory staff), and covers Sinai's book about martingales and most of Durrett except chapter 6 and the later more advanced staff about brownain motion.",,
"I strongly recommend this class. It was a good intro to probability theory and I really enjoyed the material on martingales, and brownian motion.",,
"Excellent class. Can't recommend it enough--Professor Sly is great. It's like ORF 526 but with less focus on measure theory. You go over a similar set of topics to ORF 309, but with more focus on theory and rigorously proving the assumptions made in ORF 309. If you're interested in probability I'd take both 309 and MAT 385 / ORF 526.",,
"Not sure why the last time Professor Sly taught this course it was poorly rated because this is a very good course. The professor is very clear in his lectures and provides motivation and examples of the ideas he introduce. He is also very good at answering questions and is very open to helping students. This course is very similar to ORF526 except that the professor decided to change the measure theory material into supplementary lectures and cover more on random processes. You get more in-depth into material covered in ORF309 (though you can do without taking the course) and more, and if you do want to learn the measure theory that ORF526 covers, you can watch the supplementary lectures. The problem sets were difficult but not unreasonable, and the professor is open to giving advice on how to solve them during office hours. The Sinai textbook was extremely difficult to read, but the Durett textbook was far more accessible, though neither are necessary since he uploads his notes online. Overall, this class was a very interesting course on probability theory and Professor Sly is a great and kind professor.",,
