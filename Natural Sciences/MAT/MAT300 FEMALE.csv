Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"The lectures were very hard to follow and quite boring, and the class was a lot more computational than expected (or advertised).",,
"If you're taking this, you probably have to. Go to office hours and UCA sessions as much as possible, especially if they're still using the Courant book; I also reccomend trying to get an alternate study book - trying to learn from the assigned textbook is almost impossible.",,
"This course isn't too bad, but much harder than I expected. Definitely a lot harder than MAT215 and it does get kind of computation-heavy towards the end.",,
I would recommend.,,
"It delivers exactly what it says; multivariable real analysis. Don't expect more from it, don't expect less.",,
I enjoyed this course very much as there was a fair bit of calculation of multiple integrals; I understand that that may incline others against the course.,,
"Warning: this course is not what you think it is, it barely covers manifolds and tries to use a lot of results whose language is not fully fleshed out, e.g. manifold dimension and general differential forms. Half the course is an extended version of 215, the other half is pure multivariate computation with many proofs put off as exercises and hidden in the notes and not really discussed. Unfortunately, the textbook is similarly unhelpful, as it has a lot of material, but is not presented very readably and thus is often hard to navigate; the lectures also do not follow the chapters in any linear manner, and although Chang is the most wholesome and helpful professor at office hours, her lectures are not particularly invigorating in delivery. That being said, UCAs were great, and the material is fairly thorough, and you can tell Chang has put quite some effort into writing up material for the course. just wish it was a little closer to what the syllabus described.",,
"This courses doesn't treat analysis as abstractly as MAT216/218. It is more on par with a proof-based MAT201 course, which is disappointing. Note that even though this class is the ""replacement"" of MAT350 from a couple of years ago, the material is not the same at all. The Courant textbook is near unreadable and did not help at all for homework/studying other than looking up equations. The first half of the semester was difficult as most of the homework problems were proofs, but in the second half they were all application problems.",,
"If you just finished MAT217 and are considering math, I would warn you that this is an easier class than either 215 or 217. Therefore, if you really love math, it might be worth it to take this with another math class such as algebra or topology. Other than that, its a pretty chill class, with exams that are a step up, so make sure to do lots of practice problems for them.",,
This was easier than 215/217 in some ways but be prepared to put in a lot of work because the psets are weekly.,,
"required after 215/217 for math majors but not a great course.  classes were rambling, unorganized, & basic.  lectures did not prepare students for psets well.  the psets oft became the instructional material.  mistakes in the assignments did occasionally hamper progress.",,
"Not too difficult. Psets took me around 8-10 hours per week (including reading/skimming relevant sections), few took less (3-4 hours), particularly when I saw the readings as not necessary. The content is basically a regular multi variable calculus class with proofs. For those who?ve taken such a class, some noted differences: a lot of time is spent on implicit and inverse function theorems, transformation of variables, and differential forms.",,
"If you are concentrating in mathematics and have not yet learned proof-based multivariable calculus, then you should take this course, for that knowledge is essential!",,
"This class taught me multivariable calculus well and overall it was not that difficult. I mean it is still a math course so by no means was it easy, but compared to MAT 215 and MAT 217, it was totally doable. There is also plenty of office hours and problem sessions to help get you through the homework. The UCAs were especially helpful! It also satisfied my BSE math requirement so that's a huge plus!",,
