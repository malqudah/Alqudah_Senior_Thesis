Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"While Yunqing is a great instructor with clear and interesting lectures, the time I spent on the homeworks for this class was much more than I expected. We would often find Wednesday classes emptier than Mondays because the problem set was due on Wednesday at the start of class and many were up almost all night finishing the problem set.",,
"Unfortunately Yunqing is leaving Princeton so I dunno how helpful this will be to other students -- but anyways, it is a very demanding and rigorous course covering group theory, rep theory, and Galois theory. It moves extremely quickly so you really have to be on top of the material every week. Start psets as soon as they are assigned. I would advise going to lecture since I found them helpful, but I have many friends who didn't go to lecture and just read the textbook / lecture notes and were fine. Yunqing was also very helpful and approachable during office hours (but then again she won't be teaching this course next year, big sad). If you are looking for a more applications-based course, take 340 instead. Take 345 if you really liked 217. In terms of difficulty 345 is miles harder but also much more enlightening. If you survive, you'll come out of it a much stronger mathematician.",,
"The most difficult course that I've taken at Princeton. Psets were endlessly time-consuming and felt relentless. The course should cover half the material that it does so that we can really learn about topics, rather than speeding through them without learning much at all. But if you have to take it?Tang is a very nice professor and I would recommend taking it with her.",,
I would strongly recommend taking this course as a thorough introduction to algebra up to Galois theory and representation theory. I would suggest having some basic knowledge of number theory beforehand.,,
"Yunqing is a great instructor with very helpful office hours. The class content depends largely on the instructor's choice, although I believe this is her last semester here. Problem sets would take between 20 and 25 hours to complete, average length and graded pretty nicely for the most part. Exams, on the other hand, were more difficult.",,
"Be careful with this course. Its curriculum is intense. Talk to other students about their experiences. This course has made me less compelled to be a math major, but that is merely my own perspective. You would do well to find out for yourself. And remember, there's always Applied Algebra (MAT 340), which may fit your needs better.",,
"You will learn a lot of Algebra in this class, but you will need to devote a significant portion of your time to this class. Would recommend taking with other less time intensive classes.",,
"Class is taught at an extremely fast pace, tough to keep up. Textbook (Artin) was decent but didn't give a lot of intuition, definitely worth getting another book that explains things better. And, of course, it's math at Princeton, so expect the p-sets to take over your life to a large extent (who wouldn't want two p-sets and a take-home midterm to do over fall break?)",,
This is in general a very good class on abstract algebra. Problem sets can be overwhelming at times but working them out would definitely help with understanding the material.,,
"This was a good course, but definitely my most challenging this semester. Be sure to attend every lecture and pay close attention. The pace was very fast this year. We covered both representation theory and Galois theory.",,
"Reading the book thoroughly is really important, since lectures go very quickly and there isn't time to really understand things in class. It helped me to get the info in class, and digest it later with the book.",,
"This is a time-consuming class!! Think before taking, but if you're sure about it then the material is interesting and you can flex that you learned rep theory to your friends from other schools",,
Fast-paced course with a lot of interesting material covered. Make sure to attend lectures and office hours to help make sense of readings and written work.,,
"Taking this and Complex Analysis at the same time is a bit of a time commitment, but I would definitely recommend taking this course.",,
"If you're a math major, ya gotta take this or 340. My friends in 340 spent a lotttta time drawing dodecahedrons.",,
"Interesting class, but pretty brutal as expected... It seems like they shift the focus pretty often, and this sem it was representation theory with the JP Serre textbook. Artin is fine but Serre is an evil textbook. Also Yunqing is very very kind, and although I heard great things about her as a lecturer in MAT217, she was not so clear this time around!!!",,
"The course is extremely time-consuming, but you learn a lot! The material is very interesting.",,
"If Professor Yunqing Tang ever teaches the course again, you should take it! She makes the course harder than an introductory course on abstract algebra should be, but it is very rewarding!",,
"The classes were great. Prof. Tang set out a clear goal and made sure we stay on track to finish it. We were never late with doing the material (which was great because it meant there pace was pretty fast so the classes weren't too slow). The very interesting part is that the instructor provided many background examples that might be useful in the future which increased my curiosity for the subject. Furthermore, the instructor would discuss the intuition behind the concepts which made them easier to understand and more enjoyable to think about. She was very responsive to questions. We managed to cover both representation theory up to finishing character theory (including 6 chapters from Serrre's book on the subject), Galois theory, and a lot of finite group theory. In the end it was really exciting to learn about the things that at least sound non simple. The instructor was really great and that was reflected in the quality of the lectures and the additional assignment problems (problems which weren't from the book itself but typed up by the instructor). If you are considering taking this course or a higher algebra course, definitely do it and preferably with Yunqing (or if she is permanently leaving, with someone else who is young and enthusiastic about the class as Yunqing was). Great semester and my favorite undergrad math course at Princeton so far.",,
"Great course. You will learn a lot, and Yunqing's concern for our learning was refreshing. A few of the psets are really long/difficult, but overall I found it all to be pretty manageable.",,
Professor Yunqing covered very cool topics and helped me learn a lot through problem sets.,,
"Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the psets. Dummit and Foote is also a great resource. Really interesting and beautiful topics, would highly recommend if you're a math major.",,
"Yunqing lectures very well and cares about her students. We managed to cover group theory, some rep theory and some Galois theory in one semester. The material was enjoyable and enlightening. Psets got significantly easier after the entire class got decimated by the midterm and people complained. Otherwise, a very well taught class. It's a pity that Yunqing will be leaving for Paris after this semester.",,
"Good course. The course was too fast paced especially in the middle, but it was reasonable in the beginning and end.",,
"It is a hard class, but the lecture and the readings were well structured to make the understanding of the materials quite easy.Be prepared to spend a lot of time on it.",,
