Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
It is a very interesting class and you build the base for the next level math classes,,
If you don't have to take this course I would not recommend it,,
Take time to sit on your own and revise all that you learned in the lectures and the precept.,,
Do not take this class unless you really do not understand the fundamentals of calculus.,,
I think having some Pre-Cal background knowledge would be helpful. There is a set curve so it is difficult.,,
take it if you need to,,
Recommended if you have to take this class.,,
Use office hours and McGraw tutoring. They also have videos on canvas that explain the material you learn in each class and those were very helpful when I didn't fully understand the material in class,,
Make sure you attend class and pay attention,,
Take it if you like math or want to satisfy the QCR. My experience with math-learning has always been disastrous - although it is not the instructor's fault and I always manage to get nice grades - but I do recommend this course since there are no better alternatives for math-haters in Princeton to graduate.,,
I would recommend this course to others as everyone should take a college math class and it really helped me adapt to a new way of learning math.,,
Still hard if you aren't good at math. Go to office hours as much as possible.,,
"Only take if you have no calculus experience. This class is difficult and largely self-taught. Even for an introductory class, the tests and EPs were much more difficult than what was presented during lectures.",,
"I would advise students considering taking this course to avoid it at all costs. Unless the course is absolutely necessary for their degree, it is not worth taking. It teaches math in the most ridiculous, wasteful way possible and students would be better served learning basic calculus from a sketchy source on youtube because this will not help you learn anything.",,
Take notes during lectures and precepts as thoroughly as you can because they go very fast.,,
"Not a bad introductory math course, would recommend Tatiana if you can get her, but can be challenging especially if you haven't done math in a bit/never took past regular calculus in high school.",,
be prepared to have a fast paced class. the online notes are key and for tests use the exam archive early so you?re not cramming before tests.,,
Take it if you need a very solid foundation for the Calculus. Instructor Fan Wei is amazing.,,
Get help earlier in the semester.,,
Great choice for students who need time to review the most important Math concepts and help them adapt to the requirements and pace of Princeton University.,,
"If you attend the lectures, take detailed notes, and go to office hours and you will do well in this class.",,
"If you are unsure about MAT103, take MAT100 becaue it really does give you a firm foundation for math moving forward.",,
If you're taking this class I would reccomend getting through Calc in high school.  It was extremely hard for me and the lectures didn't help much.,,
"You would definitely need to study outside of class time and the earlier you start doing so, the better.",,
