Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Great class, prof. is extremely open and helpful, psets are reasonable in terms of difficulty.",,
"Professor Tscherbyna is great! Although the course doesn't require measure theory, the course textbooks use measure theory everywhere. This of course means that during the course you will be jumping around the book a lot and using Professor Tscherbyna's own notes. Make sure to go to office hours if you don't understand a topic as they build up and to start problem sets early.",,
Definitely the best to satisfy real analysis. Goes way beyond ORF309 and explains all the probability concepts well from a measure-theoretic perspective.,,
"Great class - the class doesn't cover as much measure theory as say ORF526, but focused on more applications. All in all great class and Professor Shcherbyna was very helpful",,
"Good introduction to rigorous probability theory. It's quite unlike anything from ORF309, but knowing some tricks will definitely be useful. Generally this course provides enough exposure to most of the concepts one would need in other applications. Weekly problem sets were not too long, usually doable within 5 hours.",,
"Good for probability theory; it doesn't have too many applications if you're outside the math department (physics, orfe, etc.)",,
Some background in analysis is needed. Stay focused.,,
"A good course that explores the modern formulation of probability. Covers a solid range of topics, and difficulty is very manageable. Not necessarily a pure theory course.",,
Harder than I expected having no experience with probability before  but very interesting and rewarding,,
The course covers a lot of beautiful probability theory.  Pay good attention in lectures because the textbook is difficult to read.,,
