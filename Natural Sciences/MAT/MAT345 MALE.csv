Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Having access to written (pdf) lecture notes this term was super helpful, so I hope that continues in the future. I've heard some complaints about the problem sets and exams having unclear terminology (for example instead of saying 'there is a structure A isomorphic to [a famous structure] B that does X' it will usually just says 'B can do X'), but that's not the professor's fault - doing this is the norm in maths and it's really unfair to blame it on the professor.Much of what has to be done in problem sets and exams is decoding what the terminology and notation refers to, which I personally find very exciting but might not be what you prefer.Overall I would say it is a fairly easy course if you did moderately well in MAT216-218 and it isn't too much work.",,
Curve is awful for a math class.,,
"One of the TAs was constantly dismissive and rude in the problem set feedback. There were many, many times that I thought problem set grading was overly harsh or anal, and many, many problems that felt ambiguous in their wording.This class suffered from a huge difference in notation between the lectures and textbook, which bled over into the problem sets. The order of subjects in the lectures and textbook are almost completely different, so there were many times when the textbook had established something that we had not talked about in lecture, or vice versa.The lectures were boring.",,
"This course is pretty cool but somewhat challenging. Depending on the professor it may be graded nicely or very harshly, so ask your friends about the professor before taking.",,
"If you're not a MAT major, only take this if you're really interested and also prepared for heavy math",,
"This class changes every year. If you notice that your professor does not give good examples, does not work them out in class, it is probably a good idea to take it in different year. The problem sets for this class were very long and many times completely disconnected from the material we covered in class. In previous years, it seemed that algebra had been taught better and was more manageable, so it can really change from year to year. It was really stressful to have to spend days trying to understand what the problem sets were asking, since they were considerably different from class. Therefore, if you notice that in the beginning, choose a different class.",,
Star psets early.,,
"If you're a math major, you gotta take it, right? Pretty interesting overall. There'll be a wall that you might hit regarding the material of the course as a ""set of tricks."" You're not wrong, but get through it because there are more interesting concepts on the other side.",,
"If you're a math major, you are on a plane of existence above me and can do whatever you want.If you're not a math major, take 340. A friend of mine at another well-regarded university took their equivalent of 345 and covered literally half of the material we did. That is to say, this class moves ludicrously fast, has psets that take 10-15 hours, and left me more dazed and confused than rewarded at the end. 340 should get you the interesting bits without literally killing you. This class is much harder than 217, so don't think that justifies you taking it. Unless you feel more confident in your proof ability than the 30 math majors who have been doing this for much longer than you have, don't sign up to be graded on the same curve as them. It's just not worth it.",,
"Pretty intense, but nicely thought out. imo be prepared for this to be harder (or at least take more time) than most (if not all) other 300-level math classes.",,
Good course to take if you're considering a math major.,,
"Algebra is a tough course.  After taking this course, the 200 level math classes seem almost easy.  The instructor was fantastic, and really helped during the tough sections on modules.  The text for this course isn't the easiest book to read, but this appears to be the norm for math textbooks so it wasn't exactly a surprise.  This class is definitely a grind, but it takes your mathematical skills to another level.  I highly recommend for any incoming math major or any mathematically inclined STEM major.",,
"I think Algebra I is a must-take for anyone pertaining to be a math major. Prof. van Dobben de Bruyn did give his best to explain the concepts and the graders were extremely diligent with grading the psets. That being said, I do not think that there is a single iteration of this course that is not work-heavy, implying you would probably spend 4-8 hours on psets every week. Still, I think that the course is relatively rewarding though, as the material that you learn is rather broad and definitely very applicable. To conclude, this will probably be one of the central courses of your semester if you take it.",,
Be prepared to work hard. The class is interesting but very difficult if you're new or only somewhat experienced in algebra.,,
This course made me regret being a math major. I found it significantly more difficult than complex or math 216 and significantly less rewarding. The content is very abstract and remained opaque to me. Applied algebra may be a better choice for many.,,
So hard for no reason. Shoul've pdf'd,,
"This year Algebra I was thought extremely well (which unfortunately is rare for MAT345 from what I've heard). Remy's (Professor de Bruyn) classes were very well-organized and decently paced, he motivated the material well and explained everything clearly. If you have the chance to take AT345 with him (or any other math class tbh), do so!Exams were fair. Psets were not too long and not too hard. Graders were on the harsher side (subtracting even for stylistic reasons) but I think my mathematical writing really improved because of this, so I don't see it as a negative.Algebra I includes material that you should know as a math major (accent is on knowing rather than satisfying requirement here), so maybe you should take this class. That being said, I personally didn't find the material too interesting. Don't expect a lot of nice proofs as in complex or a combinatorics class for example.",,
"This class was taught very well, and Remy was a super friendly and helpful professor. I think whether you like the material or not can be kind of a hit or miss, some people reallt take to it and others are just frustrated by it. Also, this is absolutely the kind of course that needs to be your #1 priority, so don't just take it along with a bunch of other classes which require a lot of your attention. I took it with another math class, physics, and two other classes, so I felt like I didn't have nearly enough time to appreciate and become familiar with the material",,
