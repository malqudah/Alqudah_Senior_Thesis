Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"A good course to get exposed to multivariable analysis/calculus. Chao is a good professor, but make sure to let him know if you need him to slow down. The Courant book has very long paragraphs and is not divided into neat theorem and proof sections; so if you usually rely on the book too much, you might want to consider that.",,
"Chao is great. Courant/Fritz book layout/formatting is not great, so expect to rely on lecture notes. Probably more calculation problems than most 300 math classes and similar schedule to 201.",,
"Chao is a great professor and an amazing person. He is incredibly helpful during office hours and responsive to the class; if you feel that he is going too fast in lecture let him know and he will listen to you!! The questions he writes are generally very good as he seems to understand what is reasonable for someone with only 215 background to get. If the only analysis you have done is 215, please take this class before 325, 335, etc.",,
"Professor Li is such a nice guy. It was a small class, and I felt like he really was considerate about every student's needs. He was willing to adjust the homework after the midterm to be more instructive for the level of our class. He was really so kind and I very much appreciate it.",,
Follow the lectures and ask questions! This course is a little easier than 215 and 217 in my opinion and really introduces you to multivariable calculus at a more rigorous level. Chao is great if he teaches again,,
It's great if Chao Li is teaching it. Make sure to start psets in advance and go to the office hours (they are EXTREMELY helpful),,
"Take this class if you took 215/217. I took this senior year as a math major, I wish I would have taken it sophomore fall. It helps build so many fundamentals for future analysis, courses especially complex. Professor Li is a great lecturer with excellent lecture notes, and he explains very clearly at office hours as well. The textbook is not great, recommended to get a regular multivariable calc textbook to supplement and see how some of the theorems are applied in calculations.",,
