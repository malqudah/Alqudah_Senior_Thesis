"LOVED THIS CLASS! Such an important class to take if you're interested in anything SPIA/Politics related. It provides a general overview of the basics of U.S. government and the readings aren't dry at all ? I found most of them to be really interesting and eye-opening. Professor Frymer is a great lecturer, and the grading & assignments for the class are very fair. Also, try to get Alina as your preceptor - she is the best!",,
do the readings a take good notes,,
"I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is a SPIA or politics major. I thought it was a really great intro class for politics, and had good insights into the current political climate. It is not that much work.",,
Keep up with the readings. Lectures are interesting and definitely worth attending.,,
Really good quality,,
Be careful.,,
"Good fifth class for BSEs, with the minor caveat of having a sit-down final exam at the end, although the final exam was very reasonable in difficulty. Professor Frymer is awesome and funny, and the lectures are very engaging.",,
I advise taking this course. lectures are great. Not many assignments.,,
good,,
This course is great. Take it!,,
"This is a great SA for anyone, especially if you don't like writing papers. There was 1 short (3 pg) paper and a midterm and a final. Aside from that, the only work is weekly readings. Very low work load, but super interesting and Professor Frymer's lectures were really engaging. Even though there wasn't a lot of work, I still learned a lot. Might be boring if you already know a lot about American Politics though.",,
if you are an american and have taken AP Gov this course is going to be super boring. it is very introductory to american politics,,
"Highly recommend! Frymer is a great lecturer, and I loved having Alina as my preceptor. She's super approachable and great at leading discussions and explaining confusing concepts. The course felt like it would be accessible for students with little knowledge of the subject, but I still enjoyed it even though I already had some prior knowledge, and with just two exams (not too difficult, in my opinion) and one short paper, I found the workload to be manageable.",,
Take this course!,,
"If you are taking this class I would recommend doing the readings because if you fall behind on them then it is hard to catch up. Also going to lectures will help but I think in general the readings are the main focus. For the written assignment, clarify with your preceptor on what exactly they are looking for.",,
"Take this course if you need the SPIA requirement. The workload isn't too bad, and the lectures are very interesting.",,
Take this course for the SPIA departmental! The material is not difficult and Prof. Frymer's lectures are always interesting and relevant to current events. Take notes on the readings and they will save you when studying for the midterm and final.,,
do the readings,,
I would recommend this course to those interested in politics.,,
Take this course if you are looking for an easy course to satisfy a SPIA requirement that has little work during the course of the semester. Be warned that the final and midterm are intense though and represent a massive portion of your grade.,,
This class is pretty mid. preparing for exams is stressful but that is the only tough part. you can't go too wrong with it but could choose something more interesting in a better format. maybe stay away from this if you like essays better than exams,,
I would encourage them to go to lectures and go to precepts prepared having done the readings.,,
"Overall a good class. I could see parts being redundant to American students but it was very helpful from an international perspective. The papers and exams are fair and manageable. The readings are interesting, long at times but not too bad. I would recommend for the SPIA pol requirement or someone with minimal knowledge of US politics",,
Do the readings and participate in precept.,,
I'd say probably not unless you have to take it.,,
"great course, take it",,
Good and chill intro politics course. There are many readings so make sure you do them all and take notes. It was easy to follow even for a non-politics major international student.,,
"It's an easy politics course -- take for either an interest in politics, a pre-req, or a distribution requirement. The workload is light and the material is interesting.",,
Take this course as a great basis for American Politics.,,
Attend lectures and do the readings and it will be not a problem,,
"Great way to get the SA or for general interest. Don't need much prior knowledge, if any (I'm international and was fine). Go to lecture and take notes. If you do most of the readings and go to lecture then review the slides before the midterm / final you're chilling. Would recommend for sure.",,
"Fairly chill, interesting material. I already knew a fair amount about American Politics, but this class helped to give me a vocabulary to talk in a more informed way about the things that I already knew.",,
I highly recommend this class if you want a broader introduction to a variety of topics in American Politics. This class is also great if you don't want to do a lot of coursework throughout the semester (there is only one paper due and it is before the midterm). It's also a big class which is nice because you will have many peers to turn on for guidance and help.,,
great class! take it,,
Good and easy course if you have experience with American Politics.,,
"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in politics or even just wants to know more about the basics of how things work in American government/democracy. Professor Frymer does great lectures, and the readings are definitely manageable! So far, these lectures and topics have been one of my favorite at Princeton!",,
"Do the readings and you do not need to attend the lectures. For the final, the readings were integral to doing well.",,
"Take notes on the readings during the semester as it will save you a lot of time during midterms week/reading period. Also keep track of all the important concepts that are discussed, as these are what the exams focus on the most.",,
"I would recommend this course, it was an interesting dive into American politics. I enjoyed the readings and I would definitely recommend doing all of them because it is important for precept and for exams. The precepts are student-led presentations on readings, which made discussion pretty easy.",,
Be sure to do the readings- they are relevant and will help you understand the material.,,
"Good course, quite easy, very straightforward. Frymer is a good guy. Works well in a 5 class semester.",,
Would definetly take this course,,
Keep up with the readings even if you just heavily skim them and go to lecture to understand the concepts. If you do both of these things the course is no problem at all.,,
"good way to fufill the politics requirement for SPIA. great staff, interesting content",,
"Professor Frymer is a great lecturer and keeps the class interesting. It isn't very hard material and there aren't too many assignments, so doing well is very manageable so long as you keep up with the readings and go to lecture.",,
Do the readings and go to lecture!,,
"Make sure you go to lecture and take notes on what he's saying rather than what's on the slides. If you do the readings, participate in precept, and pay attention in lecture the class is fairly chill. I really enjoyed this class and Professor Frymer is great. Super knowledgeable in the field and a great professor.",,
"This course is manageable work-wise, and the readings are reasonable and interesting. Unfortunately I found the lecture content to be dry and slow. Professor Frymer and the preceptors are lovely, though. And the class should be more engaging if you have less of a background with American politics because then it will feel more new and interesting.",,
"Great for the SPIA politics core, not much work. Pretty much the same as APGov.",,
It's pretty manageable as long as you can find it in you to do the readings,,
"The course is about half political philosophy, half political institutions/processes, so don't necessarily expect to come away with a ton of exact knowledge about American politics. Pretty chill course though and Frymer is great",,
"I took this for my SPIA departmental and really liked it! If you're an international student, this will probably be a bit tougher as background knowledge of American politics and political system helps a LOT.",,
Take this class it is very interesting,,
would reccomend,,
"pretty straightforward class, material is a bit dry on occasion but it's generally easy to follow",,
"DANNY IS A LEGEND!!!!! Unfortunately, he won't be teaching again, but it needed to be said. Professor Frymer is also great. I loved this course!",,
Do the readings,,
NA,,
Make sure you do the readings so that you can participate in precepts. Ask questions about concepts you don't understand in precept because the final is closed book and you will have to understand those concepts to do well.,,
take it. You will learn a lot about our government,,
"Go to lecture, Professor Frymer does a great job of presenting the course material in an understandable way that makes precepts, papers, and the final easier.",,
Make sure to do all the readings from the beginning of the year because they really provide good context for lectures and precept and are interesting.,,
Take this course! Professor Frymer is great and the lectures are very interesting.,,
"Pretty straightforward course with minimal workload. Content is comparable to AP Gov with some more theoretical stuff added in. One short paper, midterm, final.",,
"it's an easy spia core class, took it as an international student and it was helpful for understanding american politics.",,
Yes! I recommend this class to another student. Great class to fulfill the CORE Politics requirement for SPIA,,
"TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Professor Frymer is AMAZING, and try to get Alina as a preceptor, she is phenomenal! Super interesting material",,
Split readings in a group to be productive. Take this class!,,
Engage in precept as much as possible and you will get more out of the class.,,
Take this course. I found it very interesting and the short paper was fun to write.,,
"Do the readings! They are very foundational for the course and are going to be super helpful for the midterm and final. Also go to lecture, its easy to think you can just skip them cause its recorded but itll save you so much time and stress later on.",,
Professor Frymer is so knowledgable and enthusiastic - he genuinely wants students to do well in this course and makes it so accessible and easy to understand. I learned so much in this course and did not find it overwhelming despite being an international student and having never taken any american politics classes before.,,
"Take this class for a general interest in american politics - broad enough to cover a lot of material but narrow enough that you actually learn something. Participate in everything and you'll have a good experience - go to lecture, do the readings, and go to precept.",,
"Keep up with the readings as the midterm and final exams are centered around them. Also, go to lecture because Professor Frymer?s discussion helps to break down and explain what are on his PowerPoint slides.",,
Take it. Frymer is a good lecturer and the course is not too difficult. Interesting material if you are into politics.,,
