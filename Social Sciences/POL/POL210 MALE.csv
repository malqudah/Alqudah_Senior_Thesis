Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
This class is so unique and a great way to understand political theories. Playing as a historical character makes you way more invested in the subject. Do all the readings.,,
"This basically felt like a debate / public speaking class, except the debates were historical reenactments. Can't promise what you'll learn, but it will definitely be a fun experience, and professor Hidalgo is the sweetest, most engaged and considerate professor.",,
"Absolutely take this course! Prof. Hidalgo is amazing, the roleplaying games are not only fun but really get you engaged in the ideas, if you're playing someone that you personally don't agree with you might be compelled to rethink why you don't agree with them and it's really quite profound. This is one of the best courses I've taken yet and will probably still be top 3 even when I graduate, it's that good.",,
"This is a very fun course. The roleplaying is really fun and exciting. Very different from any other course I've taken so far. There are some long readings, but not too bad. I would recommend this to anyone, though especially people who are interested in history, politics, and/or public speaking.",,
Take it! A great professor and format,,
"Definitely take this course if you are interested in a balance between fun acting, practicing rhetorics and arguments, and understanding political theory and history.",,
