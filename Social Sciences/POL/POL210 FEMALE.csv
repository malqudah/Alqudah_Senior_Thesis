Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Good as a 5th course to get a distribution requirement or if you really like political theory. You can totally get away with super quick skimming of the readings.,,
"Don't need to go to lecture. Do all readings, participate in precept, get help on essays if you need, and you will do fine.",,
"It's a very standard POL class, might be more exciting options, but this is content you should be familiar with if you haven't studied before.",,
"I highly recommend this course. It is a great introductory course for anyone who is even remotely interested in politics or theory. Prof Stilz is an excellent lecturer and she's always very clear about what the main points about the readings are. The precepts are also really interesting because the topics are always so complex so there can't really be a wrong answer. Papers aren't very difficult, and the instructors give really amazing feedback on your writing.",,
"Absolutely take this if you are interested in the readings. Readings can be heavy at times, but the workload in light outside of that and Professor Stilz is a fantastic lecturer that summarizes the main points of the readings anyway. Definitely take for distribution or general interest",,
"The lectures are dry and like most classical political theory courses, it is not immidiately obivous why it's interesting. The papers and essays are do-able and relatively easy. However, the final is time pressured and terrible unless if you do all your readings.",,
"My advice would be to do the readings because if you understand them, it makes writing the papers much easier and understanding the topics in lectures.",,
this course is great,,
"solid distribution class, i enjoyed, and i would reccomend",,
"Sure it's political theory, but its less ""let's learn what a political theory is"" and more like ""learn these political theories and figure out how they connect."" Lectures were more of a history lesson and readings were pretty hard to understand. Precepts saved me though, as they helped me understand the main ideas present in the  weekly readings. Theres four 1000 word papers that try to cover aspects of weekly concepts. The prompts are usually pretty specific and they line up with course material, so if you really want to succeed in this course, focus on one weeks pair of readings, since chances are, a prompt on those readings will probably show up. The fourth paper may also be waived for a 500 word reflection paper if the course still does the ProCES volunteering thing again (which I completely recommend doing). Take the course if you're remotely interested in the readings, and all the other politics courses seem to carry more work.",,
As an upperclassman this class is manageable. There are only four essays (<= 1000 words each) and a final. Lectures weren't always the most helpful but they were interesting. Definitely do the readings.,,
i recommend,,
"Professor Stilz is awesome. She is thoughtful, kind, and is able to convey important information very well. Sometimes the lectures were a bit boring because they were dense with history, but as you get into contemporary political thought, things get interesting. There is a ton of reading, but most of it was interesting.",,
Do the readings and actively participate,,
This is a great course if you're interested in politics and want an introduction to it. The class is pretty easy and the workload  isn't bad at all. Professor Stilz is also a great lecturer.,,
Take it. Great introduction to POL theory. Stilz is fantastic and theo was a great preceptor,,
"Take this course if you're interested in having a great theoretical foundation to the more ""practical"" politics classes you will probably encounter in the future!",,
"I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you enjoy political ethics. It definitely expands your horizons. The two things to be wary of are the lengths of readings and the effort you need to put in to the papers to do well, so be mindful of your other classes' workloads if you're considering taking this class. Otherwise, a solid 5th class.",,
not a negligible amount of work but cool readings if you're interested,,
"This course is chill but very dry, and i don?t love Prof Stilz teaching. Take if you?re considering a politics major or you?re deeply interested in political theory; don?t take just because. There are more fun, chill courses. Also, I don?t love Prof Stilz teaching style, and she seems kinda passive aggressive.",,
"Fair game for distribution, not too much work (4 thousand word essays, weekly readings that take an hour or two)",,
Have Max as your preceptor if possible. It's a very good intro course with a lot of interesting readings (that are sometimes long).,,
"This is a great course that covers a lot of interesting material. Although the readings can be a bit long, doing them each week and participating in precept conversations makes writing the papers a lot easier. Definitely sign up for the ProCES component if possible!",,
The lectures are not always interesting but the general material of the course is. Highly recommend taking the professor as your preceptor.,,
I really enjoyed the course! 10/10 recommend if you are interested in politics. Professor Stilz is a great lecturer.,,
Watch videos before and after readings,,
Great,,
"Super interesting information. You get a real overview of central topics in political thought. I'm a STEM major, but still really enjoyed the course. Pretty light workload and Prof Stilz is always more than happy to meet and think through the essay prompts with you. Try to utilize Prof Stilz as a resource, as it's super helpful in crystalizing your thoughts before writing an essay.",,
