Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Do not fall behind,,
"Great course. Noonan is a sweetheart, and very knowledgeable. Sit in the front row so you pay attention in the 300+ person lecture.",,
Attending lecture can really help make things more engaging. Also try to get Professor Noonan as your preceptor if you can!,,
"Professor Noonan is a very energetic, engaging instructor. Her office hours are very helpful for questions on the PSET, definitely take advantage of them.",,
"I would say that it's important to take effective notes during lecture, rather than writing everything down. Also, if you are having trouble solving a p-set or understanding a practice question, don't hesitate to reach out for help.",,
"As far as an intro level class goes, I think it is interesting and provides a basic look into Microeconomics. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in starting to learn about econ.",,
"Take if you have to or if you like math. It is not a lot of hard math, but it probably won't be the most interesting as a humanities student.",,
amazing professor who is really patient and nice,,
"Straightforward, and with a great and kind professor!",,
"Definitely try to get into Chris Mills's precept, he is fantastic. Also, go to office hours every week!",,
Get an iPad/print out the lecture slides ahead of time... there's information to copy down as well as graphs that are drawn in class to solid the concepts and it makes engaging in lectures a lot easier. Go to precepts as they are very chill environments and helped a lot in me understanding the concepts taking an econ class for the first time.,,
"I highly recommend taking this course, with Professor Noonan in particular! She is amazing at explaining the subject matter and is always available to answer questions and help with problem sets in office hours. My main recommendations would be 1) print or have the lecture slides available on an iPad before lecture and take notes directly on them, since it is otherwise really difficult to keep up and 2) go to office hours, they're really helpful. Take this course to decide if you want to be an Econ major or just for fun!",,
ECO100 is a solid course that can introduce you to a new way of thinking about the world that may make more sense to you. Make sure to take advantage of office hours and McGraw to reinforce your understanding of the material.,,
Rewatch the lectures and figure out your best notetaking strategies.,,
"This class is a great introduction to microeconomics, though it helps massively to have a previous background in economics as a whole before taking this class. Keeping up with lectures and precepts are integral to doing well in this class, but staying on top of problem sets and going to office hours will prove to be most beneficial for succeeding in this course.",,
Better than macro,,
Print out the lecture notes before hand so that way you can spend more time focusing on the graphs and on what professor Noonan is saying. Find a preceptor's office hours that you can go to every week to get help on the problem sets.,,
"If you wantt a solid foundation in Econ before you move to higher level courses, I definitely recommend taking this course even if you took micro in high school. The p-sets sometimes challenge you to think in new ways, and you might find that you need to go to office hours. Definitely recommend going to Professor Noonan's or Chris' office hours.",,
Go to office hours,,
"Professor Noonan is a great lecturer--very engaging and very sweet (she brought chocolate one time!), and very personal in office hours and nice, and explains the content well. The problem sets definitely take a fair amount of time every week (maybe 6-8 hours/week including office hours, all at the end of the week?), but office hours are extremely helpful, and make it easy to do well on them if you put in the effort. The exams are difficult, too, but are fair and reasonable if you put in the time to study. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to get any exposure to Economics, even if it's not something that you'll want to major in down the line.",,
I would definitely look into taking this course. It is not that much work or too difficult as long as you go to every class.,,
the course moves very fast. I took economics in high school and still struggled to keep up at times. My friends who had never taken economics before struggled a lot.,,
I don't have any advice,,
"This course was pretty difficult and was a good amount of work. The concepts are pretty dense and you can definitely not slack off. I would recommend going to office hours each week with the professor because she does a great job explaining the content learned in lectures and helps go over the problem sets. I would also recommend doing the readings to fully comprehend the lectures before class. Overall, I learned a lot in this class, but it did take a lot of my time and it was pretty difficult... very rewarding though!",,
Do take it with Professor Noonan. And try to get precept with her! It will make your overall experience in ECO 100 superior.,,
"McGraw helped me survive the PSETs, but it was a pretty enjoyable class",,
Re-read the lecture slides and p sets every week so you understand the material more.,,
Prepare to study,,
I really recommend taking this course as it lays a strong foundation for microeconomics and it wasn't too stressful. Be sure to attend lectures and precepts as well as ask clarifying questions whenever you're confused about a concept.,,
Go to office hours!,,
Do the readings!,,
Great Course! Make sure to go over the powerpoints and study those rigorously.,,
"The lectures move fast so it's a good idea to preview the slides so you have an idea of what's going on. Make sure that you don't leave concepts that confuse you hanging, because it will make understanding subsequent lectures and studying for exams hard. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! Professor Noonan does a great job of explaining confusing concepts/problems in more detail in her office hours.",,
Don't,,
"I took this class for the SPIA requirement. Compared to the other classes, this was the best choice and I still believe that. The course, compared to other economics courses, is not math heavy. Instead, many problems are solvable with neat graphs that make life 100% easier. The workload is manageable and doable 5 hours before the submission deadline, though I'd suggest working on PSETS earlier, as they will deduct points from anything that doesn't specify key words, but still has the correct message. Don't expect getting an easy grade without looking at the textbook, as lectures and precepts alone get really confusing without learning basic foundational knowledge that's found within the textbook. That being said, if you dislike math like I do and need a requirement that includes this class to fulfill it, it's probably best that you take this class.",,
"Take this course. You'll hear different things from different people: some will say it's the hardest class they took at Princeton, others will say it's a breeze. It's really somewhere in between. Lectures are big which sucks but the class is fair and interesting. You'll learn a lot but don't walk out thinking you're an expert in Econ just because you did well. Problem sets take like 3-4 hrs weekly; they test your comprehension with some tricky questions and then let you move on with your life. Exams can be tough but fair. Know this: (at least my year) if you want an A in the class you are not assisted by any sort of curve (i.e. you need a 93%). That being said, this class has problem sets which you should be getting high A+'s on and you get bonus points for coming to class. I remember getting all excited when I heard about that (wow, a chill class where you get bonus points for showing up!). Not really. this is actually Professor Noonan's clever curve in disguise. Instead of giving students a curve on exams no matter what, you have to earn your points by showing up. smart on her part. Show up and take the points. Then do well on psets. If you do that then you can get B's on the midterm and final but end up with an A in the class.",,
"Not too bad! All the material is covered in lecture and precept so if you attend those, the PSets and exams won't be crazy hard.",,
"Very standard economics class, fairly graded, but get Noonan as your preceptor if you can! She is a good lecturer but really shines in the smaller class section where you can truly get to know her/engage with interesting discussions with her.",,
if you're thinking about taking this course be prepared to utilize office hours and McGraw tutoring hours. You will have to teach yourself most of the content outside of lecture.,,
Good course to satisfy the SA requirement. Weekly problem sets are mostly doable although one would need to attend office hours to clarify questions that arise when doing the problem sets and the midterm/finals are not particularly challenging.,,
Go to office hours and get yourself a good study group.,,
Very managable. Only one assignment per week. Concepts difficult to understand at times.,,
"very easy, 2-3 h per week, nice introduction class",,
Take good lecture notes.,,
great,,
"I would recommend taking this course. The workload is very manageable, and the class is a good introduction to microeconomics.",,
"Ask questions, and try and do the psets on your own before you go to office hours. And definitely go to office hours.",,
Great course to start off in econ.,,
Enjoy,,
nice,,
The information and understanding in classes is no where near enough information to receive a high grade,,
Its easy during the weeks cause no exams but prepare for midterms and finals,,
"This is a prereq for SPIA, but it truly isn't that bad. Go to office hours for the problem sets and everything will be fine. Prof. Noonan is so sweet and so is my preceptor Chris!!",,
"If you have to take it for SPIA, it is not a terrible class, but not very interesting unless you have a passion for economics.",,
"If you are interested in understanding economics, this is a great course to take, it is very manageable if you stay on top of your work, and professor Noonan is very eager to help you grasp concepts",,
Honestly just pay attention and you will be fine,,
"The math in this course is very easy, so focus on the conceptual information and you'll do well. Reach out to Professor Noonan or any of the preceptors if you're struggling on a topic and they'll be very willing to help you out and friendly.",,
Go to office hours for questions on PSETs,,
"Be sure that you study and understand all the PSETs before going into the exams. Don't just review content. Application is the most important part of this class. Noonan and the other preceptors want you to do well, so go to office hours for any questions.",,
"GO TO OFFICE HOURS AND MCGRAW! Pretty much guaranteed 20/20 on psets if you go to office hours, which is a helpful and necessary grade bump because the exams are hard.",,
"AVOID. don't take unless you have to, it was hard/messy and unenjoyable",,
"Probably not the best option for a 5th course for engineering students. Requires more work to keep up than expected. Definitely would recommend the course however, because there is a lot of useful information learned",,
Go to Professor Noonan's Office Hours when working on PSets. You can get a solid grade without ever reading the textbook.,,
"If you have any interest in economics or just need a distribution requirement filled, this is an approachable, fair, and interesting course that I would definitely recommend.",,
"I would recommend this class as it is a very engaging distribution requirement. I definitely think that the material is easy to grasp, but the tests are mostly multiple choice which can be tricky.",,
"Let me just say do not be fooled by the classification of this course as 100 level, this course can be pretty tough at times, especially for those taking it as a SPIA prerequisite and dont have much familiarity with economics. However, there is a lot of support with office hours, precept, and McGraw. The topics are pretty applicable to the real world and you will definitely come out of this course with important knowledge. My tip is make a study group and connect with your classmates early on!",,
Use the lecture slides (with graphs). They are your best friend in this course.,,
Take this class!!!! even if you think you may not be interested. I never took any econ class before and i loved it. professor noonan is the abosolute best. go to office hours every week and your psets will be easy,,
Professor Noonan is the best. She really cares about everyone and wants her students to do well. Always so helpful.,,
"I would advise students who are going to take this class, be ready to work. This class requires a lot of work and studying, however is essential and even fun if you are excited about Economics or feel you would like to work in that field.",,
Make your own notes on lectures and precepts. Gap between midterm and final is hard.,,
"If you have already taken AP Micro in high school and are unsure if you should take this class, you still should! Even with taking both AP Micro and Macro, I felt like I was learning new material that showed some of the ""behind the scenes"" of the assumptions you make in high school economics. Noonan is a great professor, problem sets are pretty easy if you attend precept/lecture/office hours, and textbook readings are unnecessary (everything is already covered in class).",,
This course is fast-paced but very enjoyable and engaging. Be sure to make time in your schedule for Office Hours to go over problem sets.,,
"Form a study group and work on the problem sets together - this really helped increase my level of understanding. Go to office hours, go to review sessions, and work through practice exams as you prepare for the midterm and final.",,
Office hours are a must to get a good grade in this course.,,
"This class does not have unreasonable expectations, and as long as you put in the work, you should do perfectly fine. Do the problem sets each week; if you start them on time, pay attention in lecture/precept, go to office hours, and compare with peers, you should be able to get 20/20 on them, and this can really help your grade. Go to lecture and precept - you literally get bonus points for going, and if you attend every one, you get 22 free bonus points by the end of the semester, which can really come in clutch for your grade. The midterm wasn't necessarily easy, but it wasn't awful either - the questions were conceptual, so if you didn't truly understand the material or had lingering questions, some of the questions were a little rough. My biggest advice is GO TO MCGRAW GROUP STUDY HALL - they host them every Sunday (which is the day psets are due), and the tutors are literally so helpful. They'll tell you if your answers are correct, and if they're wrong, they'll make sure you actually understand why rather than just giving you the right answer. And if you go to study hall, you'll meet a bunch of other kids in the class that you can compare answers with. Still haven't taken the final yet, so I can't give advice on that - people have generally said that the final for this class is a bit easier than the midterm, but we'll see.",,
I would recommend they take the course if interested but to be prepared for difficult questions,,
"good course, attend lectures, do the sets and go to office hours",,
Do not miss office hours,,
A decent intro to the field of econ. Wasn't great and wasn't terrible. Did get pretty hard at times though.,,
"Take this class! Prof. Noonan is an incredible lecturer and I learned a ton in this class. The readings are not necessary because the lectures and precepts are so informative and the PSETs are fair, as well as helpful for learning. Even if this class isn't a requirement for you, I would recommend it for an introduction to econ!",,
"If you haven't taken economics before, it could feel very fast-paced! Reading the textbook beforehand is super helpful, and definitely go to Professor Noonan's office hours if you have any questions with the problem set.",,
"I would recommend this course to others if they were interested in economics as it is veery beneficial, especially as I watch the news and other things as I can really apply the concepts in class to the outside world.",,
"Fine course. pretty easy and low work, except around exams. The hardest part about it is dealing with poorly worded PSETS and questions. You may find it interesting, but probably just take it if you have to or are already interested.",,
Only take this course if it is a prerequisite! Preceptors are always willing to help you out and be sure to attend office hours.,,
"Professor Noonan cares about making sure we know everything she talks about, but make sure that you understand everything that she talks about or else you'll fall behind.",,
"I would suggest freshening up on algebraic/pre-calc skills before entering this class. If I had known that micro is quite math heavy and reviewed beforehand, I would have had a much smoother experience. In this course you are asked to think of mathematical equations conceptually and deeper than many students are asked to do in high school.",,
"The only way to succeed in this course is by going to office hours! You can not rely on lecture notes to understand every topic. Some topics on the problem sets are not even taught in lectures and are only clarified during office hours. Also, you get many bonus points just for showing up to lecture and precept, so keep your attendance up!",,
"GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Also, really try to understand content after the midterm to make studying for the final easier.",,
"I would strongly recommend this course but beware it is harder than you think to get an A! Professor Noonan is a fantastic lecturer and makes the material very accessible so be sure to rewatch the lecture videos before doing the PSETS / while studying for the tests. Overall, the course gives you a fantastic introduction to microeconomics and by the end you really have mastery over the material. Even though I won?t get an A, I would feel fully comfortable taking a higher level micro course. If you want to get every point for the PSETs go to OH with Noonan!",,
"Would recommend for anyone looking for a reasonable SA! I would describe it as learning intuition about how things affect other things in the business world, using very simple math (no calculus at all). I hadn't taken any econ before, and it was pretty doable in a 5-class semester. There are weekly psets which are a reasonable amount of work but not way too much, and I would highly recommend finding a group to check psets with. Office hours are also super helpful for psets. Precept is also very helpful - you go over things that you don't in lecture.",,
"Do your PSETS early (and correctly), study hard, and go to office hours.",,
This course moves quickly so make sure you are going to all the lectures/precepts!,,
"Attend lecture, attend precepts, and attend office hours before exams.",,
A big course that can make you feel a bit removed. Engage with your preceptor and ask questions. Go to office hours. Overall a pretty bland introduction into free-market economics. Not hard to see how Princeton produces so many Goldman bros with classes like this.,,
I would say that you should go to every lecture and precept in order to keep up with the content. If you miss one class you may not be able to understand the content of the next class. Pay attention to the graphs and the lectures in general and start the psets early in the week.,,
Go to office hours!,,
This is a very well run class--the subject matter is relatively dry but the lectures are well organized and the problem sets are not too much of a burden if you go to McGraw!,,
"If you need to take it, take it. Otherwise, don't. Professor Noonan is great, but the course is basic enough that what you cover just isn't that interesting or fun.",,
Attend lecture,,
"If you have taken calculus or are generally math-oriented, this course should be an easy A. Prof. Noonan is a good lecturer. Problem sets are fairly easy and come directly from precept and lecture.",,
I think for most people ECO 100 is for a distributional requirement. as long as you pass this class you are fine.,,
"Overall, this course is a solid introduction to microeconomics. The first half of the semester focuses on consumers, whereas the second half is more focused on theories of firms. When working through the problem sets, use the pre-recorded lectures and annotated slides to refresh yourself on the content after lecture and rewatch the process behind drawing the graphs, which can help you see the problems from a fresh angle.",,
You get out what you put into this course. Go to office hours and precepts and you will do well. Professor Noonan is a great lecturer and makes the topic of microeconomics seem interesting.,,
"Do your best to show up to lectures and precepts, especially precepts since new material is covered in them quite often. Trying to attend weekly office hours will also save you study time later on-these weekly moments to ask questions really made all the difference.",,
