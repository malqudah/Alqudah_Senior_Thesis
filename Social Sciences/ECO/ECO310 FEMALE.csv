Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take it if you have to, Dr. Wilson is amazing, and the workload is super light",,
Bland class.,,
This course builds on ECO100 and is fairly straightforward to understand. It was interesting to learn and had a fair workload to balance my class schedule.,,
"The course was okay for me, but not great, which is why I changed my prospective major after this semester from economics to politics. The precepts are not very valuable, in my opinion, as they're just practice problems. But Wilson is very helpful, especially in office hours. Lectures are pretty dry, as it's pretty much just reading from the slides, but I was glad we didn't have to read from a textbook. Wilson is often takes too long on the slides, leaving some slides for the next class or, in once instance, a lecture was given to preceptors to present. That might not necessarily be a problem because the scheduling ultimately turns out fine, but I would rather have all the slides covered in lecture, personally.Definitely form a group to work on problem sets, or else it'll be difficult and you're likely to make mistakes.",,
Good course. I particularly liked the last part on game theory. PSET about every two weeks. Math is mainly calculus and algebra. I learned a good amount and am happy I took the course.,,
"Take this class with Professor Wilson. She really cares for her students, created an incredibly fair and engaging environment, and you will end up doing well in the class too.",,
"The class is what you would expect: ECO100 with more math. The math, however, doesn't really go beyond partial derivatives and intuitive, informal proofs, so very very doable (I only took MAT175 and retained nothing from that class whatsoever)! Prof. Wilson has really clear expectations, which she neatly outlines on a review sheet before each exam. The exams aren't bad and very similar to the past exams she provides. Also shoutout to the preceptors, Ana and Leon! They always went over the necessary math (a bit of set theory, Lagrange, describing normal form games) and provided very useful practice questions.",,
The first half of the class is much harder than the second half of the class,,
Enjoy math and logical thinking if you're considering this course. Devote time and energy to learning the material well. Wilson was great!,,
Sometimes questions can be tricky but you will be fine if you follow along with the lectures.,,
I wouldn?t worry too much about attending lectures,,
"This course was less engaging than 100, but I think it's still worth taking if you have an interest in micro (or if you need to for your major/certificate). Problem sets aren't too hard, but exams can be tricky.",,
"Only take this is you are comfortable with math. Andrea is a nice professor, but you won't do well on the midterm if you don't have great intuition. Beware there are lots of BSE majors who find this easy, so if you're doing this for SPIA, take 300. Don't expect to take away things that you can apply to the real world either. Nonetheless, you can still get an A.",,
"This course is fine. Not too hard, and the math component is very doable. Prof. Wilson did not always seem super engaged, but it was interesting enough",,
"Take this course for an ORFE departmental if you liked ECO 100 and don't mind being bored in lectures, but be prepared to study a lot for exams.",,
Take this if you're a math major. Easy A/A+.,,
"Definitely take 310 over 300 - the most complex math you'll need are basic proofs and partial derivatives, and it enhances your understanding of the material. Professor Wilson assigns 5 problem sets per semester, so the workload is very manageable.",,
good class,,
"Professor Wilson is very kind and clearly cares about her students. Collaboration is allowed on all five problem sets which take at most 5-6 hours each. The midterm and final are weighted pretty heavily but the professor provides adequate review materials and is clear about her expectations. As someone with a COS background, this course most closely resembles COS445. There is also some overlap with POL250. No prior experience in economics is necessary to do well.",,
easy A,,
Take it for all reasons. If you have Ms.Wilson then it's an added bonus.,,
The exams are harder than the psets so really know how to apply the concepts.,,
know how to take a derivative,,
"Not too difficult, interesting material towards the end",,
RIP Mavi,,
