She is amazing at explaining the subject matter and is always available to answer questions and help with problem sets in office hours. My main recommendations would be 1) print or have the lecture slides available on an iPad before lecture and take notes directly on them, since it is otherwise really difficult to keep up and 2) go to office hours, they're really helpful. Take this course to decide if you want to be an Econ major or just for fun!</div>

Make sure to take advantage of office hours and McGraw to reinforce your understanding of the material.</div>

Keeping up with lectures and precepts are integral to doing well in this class, but staying on top of problem sets and going to office hours will prove to be most beneficial for succeeding in this course.</div>

Find a preceptor's office hours that you can go to every week to get help on the problem sets. </div>

The p-sets sometimes challenge you to think in new ways, and you might find that you need to go to office hours. Definitely recommend going to Professor Noonan's or Chris' office hours. </div>

The problem sets definitely take a fair amount of time every week (maybe 6-8 hours/week including office hours, all at the end of the week?), but office hours are extremely helpful, and make it easy to do well on them if you put in the effort. The exams are difficult, too, but are fair and reasonable if you put in the time to study. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to get any exposure to Economics, even if it's not something that you'll want to major in down the line. </div>

The concepts are pretty dense and you can definitely not slack off. I would recommend going to office hours each week with the professor because she does a great job explaining the content learned in lectures and helps go over the problem sets. I would also recommend doing the readings to fully comprehend the lectures before class. Overall, I learned a lot in this class, but it did take a lot of my time and it was pretty difficult... very rewarding though!</div>

Make sure that you don't leave concepts that confuse you hanging, because it will make understanding subsequent lectures and studying for exams hard. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! Professor Noonan does a great job of explaining confusing concepts/problems in more detail in her office hours.</div>

Compared to the other classes, this was the best choice and I still believe that. The course, compared to other economics courses, is not math heavy. Instead, many problems are solvable with neat graphs that make life 100% easier. The workload is manageable and doable 5 hours before the submission deadline, though I'd suggest working on PSETS earlier, as they will deduct points from anything that doesn't specify key words, but still has the correct message. Don't expect getting an easy grade without looking at the textbook, as lectures and precepts alone get really confusing without learning basic foundational knowledge that's found within the textbook. That being said, if you dislike math like I do and need a requirement that includes this class to fulfill it, it's probably best that you take this class.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Take this course. You'll hear different things from different people: some will say it's the hardest class they took at Princeton, others will say it's a breeze. It's really somewhere in between. Lectures are big which sucks but the class is fair and interesting. You'll learn a lot but don't walk out thinking you're an expert in Econ just because you did well. Problem sets take like 3-4 hrs weekly; they test your comprehension with some tricky questions and then let you move on with your life. Exams can be tough but fair. Know this: (at least my year) if you want an A in the class you are not assisted by any sort of curve (i.e. you need a 93%). That being said, this class has problem sets which you should be getting high A+'s on and you get bonus points for coming to class. I remember getting all excited when I heard about that (wow, a chill class where you get bonus points for showing up!). Not really. this is actually Professor Noonan's clever curve in disguise. Instead of giving students a curve on exams no matter what, you have to earn your points by showing up. smart on her part. Show up and take the points. Then do well on psets. If you do that then you can get B's on the midterm and final but end up with an A in the class.</div>

Do the problem sets each week; if you start them on time, pay attention in lecture/precept, go to office hours, and compare with peers, you should be able to get 20/20 on them, and this can really help your grade. Go to lecture and precept - you literally get bonus points for going, and if you attend every one, you get 22 free bonus points by the end of the semester, which can really come in clutch for your grade. The midterm wasn't necessarily easy, but it wasn't awful either - the questions were conceptual, so if you didn't truly understand the material or had lingering questions, some of the questions were a little rough. My biggest advice is GO TO MCGRAW GROUP STUDY HALL - they host them every Sunday (which is the day psets are due), and the tutors are literally so helpful. They'll tell you if your answers are correct, and if they're wrong, they'll make sure you actually understand why rather than just giving you the right answer. And if you go to study hall, you'll meet a bunch of other kids in the class that you can compare answers with. Still haven't taken the final yet, so I can't give advice on that - people have generally said that the final for this class is a bit easier than the midterm, but we'll see.</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Take this class! Prof. Noonan is an incredible lecturer and I learned a ton in this class. The readings are not necessary because the lectures and precepts are so informative and the PSETs are fair, as well as helpful for learning. Even if this class isn't a requirement for you, I would recommend it for an introduction to econ! </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">If you haven't taken economics before, it could feel very fast-paced! Reading the textbook beforehand is super helpful, and definitely go to Professor Noonan's office hours if you have any questions with the problem set. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would recommend this course to others if they were interested in economics as it is veery beneficial, especially as I watch the news and other things as I can really apply the concepts in class to the outside world.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Fine course. pretty easy and low work, except around exams. The hardest part about it is dealing with poorly worded PSETS and questions. You may find it interesting, but probably just take it if you have to or are already interested. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Only take this course if it is a prerequisite! Preceptors are always willing to help you out and be sure to attend office hours. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Professor Noonan cares about making sure we know everything she talks about, but make sure that you understand everything that she talks about or else you'll fall behind.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would suggest freshening up on algebraic/pre-calc skills before entering this class. If I had known that micro is quite math heavy and reviewed beforehand, I would have had a much smoother experience. In this course you are asked to think of mathematical equations conceptually and deeper than many students are asked to do in high school.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">The only way to succeed in this course is by going to office hours! You can not rely on lecture notes to understand every topic. Some topics on the problem sets are not even taught in lectures and are only clarified during office hours. Also, you get many bonus points just for showing up to lecture and precept, so keep your attendance up!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Also, really try to understand content after the midterm to make studying for the final easier.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would strongly recommend this course but beware it is harder than you think to get an A! Professor Noonan is a fantastic lecturer and makes the material very accessible so be sure to rewatch the lecture videos before doing the PSETS / while studying for the tests. Overall, the course gives you a fantastic introduction to microeconomics and by the end you really have mastery over the material. Even though I won?t get an A, I would feel fully comfortable taking a higher level micro course. If you want to get every point for the PSETs go to OH with Noonan!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Would recommend for anyone looking for a reasonable SA! I would describe it as learning intuition about how things affect other things in the business world, using very simple math (no calculus at all). I hadn't taken any econ before, and it was pretty doable in a 5-class semester. There are weekly psets which are a reasonable amount of work but not way too much, and I would highly recommend finding a group to check psets with. Office hours are also super helpful for psets. Precept is also very helpful - you go over things that you don't in lecture.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Do your PSETS early (and correctly), study hard, and go to office hours.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This course moves quickly so make sure you are going to all the lectures/precepts!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Attend lecture, attend precepts, and attend office hours before exams. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">A big course that can make you feel a bit removed. Engage with your preceptor and ask questions. Go to office hours. Overall a pretty bland introduction into free-market economics. Not hard to see how Princeton produces so many Goldman bros with classes like this. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would say that you should go to every lecture and precept in order to keep up with the content. If you miss one class you may not be able to understand the content of the next class. Pay attention to the graphs and the lectures in general and start the psets early in the week.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Go to office hours!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a very well run class--the subject matter is relatively dry but the lectures are well organized and the problem sets are not too much of a burden if you go to McGraw!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">If you need to take it, take it. Otherwise, don't. Professor Noonan is great, but the course is basic enough that what you cover just isn't that interesting or fun.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Attend lecture</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">If you have taken calculus or are generally math-oriented, this course should be an easy A. Prof. Noonan is a good lecturer. Problem sets are fairly easy and come directly from precept and lecture.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I think for most people ECO 100 is for a distributional requirement. as long as you pass this class you are fine. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Overall, this course is a solid introduction to microeconomics. The first half of the semester focuses on consumers, whereas the second half is more focused on theories of firms. When working through the problem sets, use the pre-recorded lectures and annotated slides to refresh yourself on the content after lecture and rewatch the process behind drawing the graphs, which can help you see the problems from a fresh angle. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">You get out what you put into this course. Go to office hours and precepts and you will do well. Professor Noonan is a great lecturer and makes the topic of microeconomics seem interesting. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Do your best to show up to lectures and precepts, especially precepts since new material is covered in them quite often. Trying to attend weekly office hours will also save you study time later on-these weekly moments to ask questions really made all the difference.</div>
