Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
You might have to do some of the learning on your own but a pretty easy course,,
I have never had a course more disorganized then it was this spring,,
"I mean, if you have to take it then just do it. If you're taking it with Wenli, literally don't bother going to class and just read the textbook. Idk how it happened but she took material directly from the textbook and somehow made it super confusing. I don't know how ECO311 is, but I'd imagine the teaching is better. Having taken ECO310, it seems that the difference between 311 and 301 is only the math, not the econ material.",,
this course isn't that much of a development from beginning econ classes don't take it unless you have to. a lot of interesting information especially if you're into econ but otherwise can be boring,,
If you're an econ major you will have to grind through this - just keep up because second half of the semester content hits you pretty hard. Also read the textbook.,,
I would stay on top of the problem sets to understand this course.,,
Bad,,
"Professor Li has a lot of real-world experience and loves to relate class material with what is going on in the world at the moment. However, it can often be hard to tell how lecture material relates to the psets, which are mostly drawn from the textbook - it almost feels like the lectures are supplementing the textbook, instead of the other way around? Professor Li also doesn't post practice exams/material for the midterm and final, either, which makes it hard to prepare for the exams, so take at your own risk, I guess?",,
Take it and get past it if your an Econ major,,
"If offered with Prof Wenli Li, beware that she likes calling for participation in lecture and sometimes puts certain students on the spot. She can be patronizing to individuals and the entire class if you/we don't understand something right away.",,
"If professor Li is teaching this course, you might as well just prepare to teach the material to yourself. Lectures were very unorganized early on in the semester and preceptors has poor communication with the professor which made It difficult for students to ask questions regarding material that was supposed to be taught tin class. Take 311.",,
Take good notes and do the readings,,
Read the textbook really closely. It will save you for problem sets.,,
Departmental. Boring.,,
"Not a super challenging course if you read the textbook and do the psets. The content may be dry at times, but Professor Li is very funny and tries to make lectures engaging by asking questions and sharing personal anecdotes. The class was slightly disorganized in terms of pacing but Professor Li was understanding and tried to adapt, especially after we moved to online classes.",,
"very important course for your learning of economics for econ majors, would not recommend this course with this professor however",,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS TEACHER. SHE IS NOT A GREAT TEACHER AND HATES THE STUDENTS. She outright insults kids for not understanding material and refuses to explain concepts when everyone is confused. I think this class could be good, but promise it will not be if she is teaching it again. But I do not think she will since she said and I quote ""I dont care if you all hate me since I am not teaching this class again"" STAY AWAY",,
pretty solid,,
Often unclear what expectations and policies are so make sure you know what's going on.,,
"Professor Li is very likeable and funny, and she makes some great connections to current events in class. Her class definitely inspired me to keep up more with current market and economy stuff. However, the course was a bit disorganized and expectations were not super clear in the beginning. I think this is likely to be smoother in future semesters, though.",,
Do not take this course... You will have to do all the learning yourself.,,
"If you're not an ECO major why would you take this?? Wenli is super knowledgeable and a good human being, but she just should not be teaching ECO300. She would be phenomenal teaching 400 level Econ courses just not non-math track macro. Like macro is going to have bad reviews anyway, and the coronavirus shift didn't help either.",,
Professor Li is a character. Not sure if a good or bad one... the concepts are easy if you stay ahead of them. Don't fall behind because the topics build off each other.,,
No comment,,
"If you have to take this course, have Professor Li clarify which textbook sections each lecture covers so that you can learn the material on your own.",,
Take this ocurse,,
"Do not take this course with Professor Li. Her teaching is bad and her grading policies are completely disorganized and nonsensical. If you must take this class, don't go to any of the lectures and just read the textbook instead.",,
"Be prepared for a lot of self studying, that is the easier way to learn the material than going to the lectures, which after a few were clear were pretty useless to attend",,
Fast paced and requires independent work to understand the material,,
"Lectures had interesting content, but overall the fact that this class is often passed from visiting prof to visiting prof, tremendously hurts the course.  Very little material was given for preparation for exams, and the actual math behind many of the models while not that complicated(nothing worse than partial derivatives) was poorly taught as you see very little examples of the types of problems you will be tested on outside of assignments and occasionally in precepts.  The content of the class is quite interesting, but the execution was extremely poor this semester in teaching it with a professor who seemed to put very little effort into anything outside of lectures.",,
"Wenli Li is a great lecturer and I am so glad I had the chance to take this class with her, especially since she found a way to relate actual news and economical data and made us think about it in a different way (and this was even before the COVID pandemic spread far)! This is a core, and was taught really well! If Prof. Li is ever in Princeton again TAKE HER COURSE!",,
