Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Go to precept - that's where you learn.,,
go to office hours and understand practice midterm and final,,
You will get most of your understanding of the material out of the Problem Sets.,,
Do not take unless you have to.,,
"Eh...professor crammed several chapters-worth of content and psets towards the end, but preceptors were helpful. On the upside, attending lectures is truly optional with Zaidi, and he does well at preparing us for exams.",,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof Zaidi's lectures are so difficult to follow, he skips over the actually important material, course timeline is awful (2 psets and 3 chapters covered before midterms and 4 psets and 12 chapters covered after midterms). Rafael was a good preceptor but even the preceptors were so confused about what was going on in the class, didn't seem to know how to do homework, etc.",,
My advice would be to read the textbook and also work with others on problem sets because it is allowed in the class and makes it a lot easier to do well.,,
take if you need to. Not fun and annoying but depends on your professors,,
Have to take it and can be fairly interesting/applicable to broad finance principles.,,
"If we can hire preceptor Rafael Schwalb (or someone with his teaching ability) to teach the course as a professor, ECO 301 would be resurrected from the grave. Right now it is a brutal course to get through. Not saying everyone would attend with Rafael, but his Monday morning precept is packed every week and he does a great job. Just going to have to strap in and get through the material if you are an Econ major, do not take otherwise.",,
Do it with a different professor.,,
n/a,,
It's an average course. Precepts are helpful. Professor Zaidi isn't always very clear and the attendance at lecture was really low. Sometimes he goes into more detail with his own experiences at the IMF which can be interesting and he can be really funny. His exams are very fair.,,
"DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. If you do, focus on the textbooks, psets, and trying to pay attention to the lecture examples.",,
do the psets and go to precept,,
"Prof. Zaidi is incapable of lecturing. He rambles on and on while skipping everything important. You can teach yourself everything just from the lecture slides and referencing the textbook. So skip lecture (please, I promise your time is worth more) but go to precepts. Preceptors actually explain the course content and connect it to practice problems. They will also give you all of the answers to problem set questions during office hours. I used to never go to office hours, but Prof. Zaidi's problem sets were so poorly written that it became necessary (you have to know which arbitrary ""assumptions"" to make to answer the question). Exams are a joke because Prof. Zaidi just copy-pastes the practice midterm and final that he's already given solutions for in Canvas. It's an insult to any student who actually bothers to teach themselves the material, since all you need for an A is to memorize a few (poorly worded) explanations.",,
you don't have a choice so suffer through it I suppose,,
Only take if you have to,,
"Only take if you need to. The lectures are taught very poorly. The preceptors, especially Rafael, were super helpful in actually trying to understand the material and do the psets. Rely on the textbook and online sources to have a deep understanding of what is going on.",,
"Problem Sets are the most difficult part of the class (and those are not too hard). Just start them on time, review the lecture material and read the textbook and you should be fine.",,
Take for requirement only,,
Take it only if you have to (aka for econ departmental). Textbook is much more helpful than the instructor.,,
"Lectures honestly were not too good. Professor Iqbal is a nice guy and has a lot of great experience but the lecture content went too slow in the beginning of the class and then had to speed up rapidly towards the end to compensate and cover all of the relevant material. Psets were fine. There were 6 in total, but the first 2 happened pre-midterm and the last 4 were kind of crammed into the end of the semester making things unnecessarily stressful and delayed. Precepts with Eugenia were probably the most useful to learn the content and ask questions and get in-depth explanations of certain equations or models. The overall quality of the class was pretty bad. By the end, lectures were hard to follow, and I ended up just relying on the textbook and slides separately to learn most of the content.",,
Dont unless you have to,,
Read the textbook and consult preceptors if you have any questions on the homework/problem set assignments.,,
This is a good course. It was difficult but not too much.,,
I think this semester was just an anomaly,,
"Go to precept, read lecture slides",,
Not worth going to lecture. Get the textbook to do the PSETs and study for exams.,,
"Rely on the textbook to really understand the material, lectures are often a bit chaotic and didn't add much to my understanding",,
"You're probably only taking this course because you have to. It wasn't great this semester, but Prof. Zaidi got thrown into teaching it last minute when the other professor suddenly couldn't make it any longer. He tried to do his best, but even then it wasn't great. Fortunately, he's giving us a better curve at least.",,
"Only take this course if you need it as a departmental requirement. If you take it, sign up for Rafael's precept - he is a great preceptor!",,
"Attend the precepts and ask as much questions as possible. IF feasible, also go to office hours",,
Do not take this class with professor Iqbal it was the worst decision I made,,
"You will have to teach yourself most of the material, so separate enough time for that.",,
Don't take spring with Professor Zaidi.,,
Self teach yourself everything,,
"I would assume many people that are not economics concentrators are not taking this course, but it does explain big concepts within the macroeconomy that are interesting and important to learn about.",,
Read the textbook and pray.,,
Going to office hours for this course was really helpful and both Prof. Zaidi and the preceptors were dedicated to helpind students succeed.,,
required course,,
No.,,
Read the textbook to learn material,,
"Take with Rafael SCHWaab, best preceptor. If ZAIDI is teaching the class may want to reconsider.",,
"This course was very poorly taught. If you end up with this professor, you must self-study all the material from scratch.",,
"If you?re an Econ major, wait until Iqbal Zaidi isn?t the professor for this class to take it. If you need to take this class and he is the professor, then just read the textbook.",,
Do not take unless you have to especially if Professor Zaidi is teaching. This class is poorly taught which makes it more difficult than it needs to be. You will probably end up using the textbook to teach yourself everything.,,
Prof. Zaidi's lectures were unclear and a bit hard to understand. Probably better off just reading the textbook and lecture slides,,
"This might possibly be the worst course I've taken at Princeton so far?please do not take this course unless you are an Economics major who needs the class for a core requirement. While the class isn't necessarily difficult, I had to spend the entire semester teaching myself the content because Professor Zaidi frequently goes off-topic when he's teaching and he poorly explains much of the economics concepts and theories needed for PSETs and exams. If Rafael is still a preceptor next year, his precept is a must-take?it's so helpful in clarifying what's happening in class, and he's very willing to help you work through PSETs, which I really appreciated.",,
"I think that everything you learn in this class is essential, as it pertains to the outside world and issues that are discussed every day.",,
"- Do the readings, which will provide a much more in-depth understanding than the lectures since the lectures are just reviewing the content of the readings with occasionally new content- You can honestly get by without going to lectures or precepts but the professor and preceptors are good resources to really push your understanding and curiosity in economics",,
