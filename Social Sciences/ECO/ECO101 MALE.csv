Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"This class is a great introduction to economics in general. It's not too much work. Even if you don't stay on top of readings, they still go over the information in Precepts. If you know a lot about US politics, then you're at an advantage. Otherwise (like if you're not from the US), you may have to review that.",,
"Take this course, and with Professor Blinder if you can. You get a good understanding of some fundamental economic principles.",,
"Keep up with the bi-weekly-ish psets and weekly reading and you should be fine, the assessments aren't too taxing.",,
This course should be required for all students because it exposes you to the issues that structure our entire economy today and provide students with the base understanding for the issues we face. This course is manageable and I would recommend it purely for Blinder's lectures.,,
"Highly recommend you take this class, whoever you are.",,
"This is a class with a heavy work load. While manageable and not so difficult at times, expect to dedicate significant time to bi-weekly problem sets, two midterms, a beast of a final as well as a Dean's Date essay. The material is important and helped me become a more informed citizen, but the class is structured as an extremely burdensome class, disproportionately to other into classes I had taken. Consider this if taking as a fifth class.",,
"Do the readings ahead of the lectures and precepts, and don't try to do the entire pset in one night. Office hours are very helpful so try to go to those whenever you can, especially if you don't understand something.",,
"This course is really interesting and you learn a lot, the final few weeks of the semester are pretty complex material which can be hard to understand. Do problem sets with other people! They're not too bad, but it helps to understand things conceptually when you discuss them with other people. And show up to precept, it helps a lot. You don't really need to read the textbook, just pay attention in class and do the external readings for your own growth, it helps to understand how this stuff applies to the real world.",,
"This is a great introduction to economics, and helpful in understanding the basics of economics.",,
"I feel as though you never really know where you stand in the class. You can sometimes capture an understanding of the material, but it does not translate to a high test score. Therefore, you really need to put in the work because you can easily feel left behind",,
Professor Blinder is absolutely great and this course feels applicable to the real world.,,
"I took this class with Prof. Blinder - it was a great class! The workload is very manageable, but it will make your life easier if you keep up with the material, as each week really does build up on previous concepts. Dan McGee is a great preceptor.",,
"I think SPIA should make students take macro instead of micro. It is so relevant to the world and crucial to understanding government and the economy... students shouldn't graduate Princeton without taking this course, especially if they're SPIA/POL/Econ/wanting to do anything related to the government or economy. Well taught, very helpful professor and preceptors, good intro class. (took as an upperclassman)",,
"Only take this course if you have to or you're super interested in macroeconomics. If you're looking to take it as a distribution, there are more exciting SAs out there. Textbook readings are tedious and long, but try to keep up every week and you'll be fine. The problem sets are also very helpful preparation for exams, and go to office hours if you're confused!",,
"Take detailed notes on the readings and make sure you understand everything on a broader, conceptual level, as well as being able to do the math.",,
Be prepared for a lot of reading and learning how to do some problem sets on your own.,,
Blinder's assignments are unnecessarily challenging. Class is more focused on current/historical economic events rather than economic concepts.,,
Provides a strong foundation for thinking about economic issues. Precepts are dry but lectures are interesting and connected to current events,,
Some advice I would give to other students is to follow the readings because topics will be a lot clearer as the course progresses as topics build on one another.,,
This class is a great intro to macro and helps set up a foundation of understanding the economy in the real world. Blinder's addition of the pandemic into the curriculum was pretty interesting and made you more engaged with the class.,,
"You should definitely take this course because it is very important to learn about the basics of economics. It is quite intense, but that makes it even better:)",,
Be prepared for a lot of self teaching on all the problem based questions (i.e. Psets and questions like that). lectures are interesting but not quite pertinent to the Psets or many exam questions.,,
I would say the course is interesting and that it is not too difficult if you go to lectures and start the psets early.,,
Take this course if you want a background in macroeconomics.,,
"do it; you'll definitely come out of it a much more informed consumer of economic literature and policy, and you'll get a good understanding of the basics of U.S. economic systems.",,
Definitely take precept with Dan the Man. Always looking forward to answering your questions,,
Very useful class to understand basic macroeconomic concepts.,,
I mean is ECO101. It's easy if you pay attention. Textbook readings are NOT OPTIONAL. Blinder likes to talk about random irrelevant statistics in lecture so you need to read the textbook to actually understand concepts.,,
"This was honestly a very good class if you put in the work and were engaged with the material. Blinder did a great job incorporating current topics such as the 2020 pandemic, which made the class especially relevant. I took this class as an intended econ major, but I would highly recommend it over eco 300 even for non-econ majors as the material is highly relevant in understanding the reasoning behind current economic and political decisions in our world. A good class to PDF if you are a non-econ major, as it does require a bit of work to get an A.",,
Please consider taking this course especially if Professor Blinder is teaching it.,,
"This class is very well-taught with Professor Blinder. Mostly study your lecture notes and problem sets for exams, but reading the textbook is helpful in gaining a better understanding of the material.",,
Read the textbook.,,
"Professor Blinder is a gem - likely one of the most knowledgeable professors in the world teaching 100 level economics. Read the book (he wrote it) because it will give you everything you need for PSETs and tests. If you have to take it, it shouldn't worry you, if you don't have to take it, it's a good class to teach you how the global and domestic economy works.",,
"This course is actually really good for a 100-level course! Take it if you need it, Professor Blinder is awesome.",,
"If you are interested in learning about economics and don't have prior experience, then I would recommend this course. You will learn a lot, but you should be prepared to devote time to the readings each week if you want to do well. I highly recommend going to McGraw tutoring to get clarification on problem set problems you find challenging--very helpful!",,
the things you learn during lecture and the material you get tested on are very different,,
An easy to follow overview of macroeconomics!,,
Stay focused in lecture; any seemingly random detail could be important for exams. Take this course if you are interested in the financial crisis or pandemic.,,
"I'd highly recommend this course as an introduction to the subject! however, beware of the surprisingly high workload.",,
"Blinder is a great lecturer, collaborate on problem sets, good intro course to gauge your interest!",,
I think this is a good entry level course to take if you are interested in economics,,
Very average class and somewhat boring but a good intro to macroeconomics. If you put in the effort the readings and psets are manageable. Just make sure to study for exams since they are worth so much of your grade. If Dan is a preceptor take it with him because he is great and his extra materials are supremely helpful.,,
"Even though I learned that I am not a fan of economics, you can't deny that the class was pretty well organized, and if you are slightly interested in economics, it is a good course to take to understand the basics. The preceptors are top notch and really try to help make sure you understand everything.",,
Try to take with Blinder if you can. Class is not difficult if you're interested in the material.,,
"Do your own research alongside what you learn in this course. While Blinder does well in addressing inequality and austerity policies, there are lots of other critiques on orthodox, growth/GDP-centered economics which he doesn't address and that give off an overly simplistic impression of what our economic priorities should be. Recommend Rethinking Economics, CORE, Kate Raworth, and Economics for Inclusive Prosperity among other insightful perspectives on our economy.",,
Do the readings and assignments as well as attend all the precepts and lectures. I would suggest taking ECO101 with Professor Blinder if possible.,,
"Definitely take this with prof. Blinder and get Dan as your preceptor. Dan makes incredible review sessions and is extremely helpful in general. Before midterms/finals make sure to go to as many review sessions as you can - preceptors say they'll all cover the same thing but in fact they don't, so it's worth attending multiple ones. Pay close attention in the lectures cause exams very directly ask for lecture stuff.",,
Make sure you do all the readings and start the problem sets early.,,
"The textbook and lectures cover the same material for the most part, but it helps to experience both nevertheless.",,
This course is not too much work and very interesting. The contents are very pertinent to everyday events.,,
Do the readings to understand the lectures better.,,
"If you do the readings and go to lecture you should be fine. Professor Blinder explains the concepts pretty well, but if you get confused by a concept reviewing it and do the readings should help. There is a decent amount of content but if you keep up, this class isn't a ton of work and provides a really solid introduction to macro.",,
Do the readings.,,
DO the readings; you will def be tested. & go to office hours! prof blinder is super friendly.,,
Do the readings,,
"This is a good course. There is nothing that stands out initially, as it is an intro macro course. But the depth of understand about economic and political decisions that it helped me developed was very significant, and it was not until near the end of the course that I realized how much I had actually learned. Anyone with interests in social analysis who don't know much about econ should definitely take this at some point.",,
"This is an interesting course, and a good introduction to macroeconomics. The material is not too difficult to understand, and the time commitment is reasonable. Professor Blinder is a good instructor, and the class felt very topical throughout. Highly recommend if you are considering it.",,
Do the readings and pay attention to the math questions on the problem set.,,
Go to the lectures and pay attention. Give yourself time to work on the PSETs. Keep up with the readings because it can be easy to let them pile up.,,
"Keep up with the textbook readings and take good notes to supplement the lectures. All of the preceptors and professors are very helpful, so don't be afraid to ask questions and attend office hours.",,
Good course,,
This is a great course to take even if you already have AP credit.,,
