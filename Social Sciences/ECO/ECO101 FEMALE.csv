Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Prof. Bogan is so passionate and knowledgable. Would 100% recommend.,,
"I can't praise the textbook enough: it's so clearly laid out and extremely accessible in its organization and process. You could learn the whole course from it. The workload's on the easier side and the tests are mostly facts, not application. Overall a very manageable course - I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn some basic econ.",,
Bogan is a much better professor than the Eco 100 professors but I still wouldn't recommend unless you have to take this course as a prospective econ major.,,
I would not discourage anyone from taking this course but I would not recommend it either.,,
Helpful to have taken Micro beforehand.,,
"Read the lecture slides thoroughly, and practice multiple choice questions before the exams. They're worth the majority, and they're tricky and intentionally made for you to mess up.",,
not too challenging but not easy either. put the work in and it's not too bad,,
Pay attention to lectures more than the slides. Review the slides before class if possible. She adds more beneficial information in lecture than are on the slides and it's difficult to get what she's saying and understand the slides without prior exposure.,,
Take it if you want to learn about how countries interact with each other. Just note that a solid understanding of some concepts as well as a LOT of reading will be required.,,
"Make sure you do the readings assigned, they are a large portion of the exams. Additionally, if you have any questions, go to your preceptor or Professor Bogan's office hours, they are extremely nice and helpful! If you can, try getting Rafael as your preceptor; he is friendly and his precepts are excellent.",,
"With Professor Bogan leaving, I don't know how applicable this will be, but for the most part, this course is doable and I think teaches a very necessary topic for any student. As a history major, I think that what I've learned is still very much useful, not only in my studies, but just in general. Make sure to put in the time and read the textbook to really understand.",,
Macroeconomics is a Princeton course.,,
Definitely take if you have any interest in pursuing economics. Professor Bogan is definitely committed to the success of her students and cares deeply about the course material. I didn't struggle too much with the class since I took AP Macro but definitely be prepared to put time into learning the material outside of class if you don't have that kind of background.,,
"I think this is a course everyone ought to take at some point in their life. It will certainly help you know a lot about the economy, and most important as to how it works. Taking this course in the time of this COVID-19 pandemic has definitely been exceptional as that has allowed me to appreciate the importance of this course even more and made me more aware of the state of the economy and the measures the governments worldwide are taking to fight the economic challenges brought about this pandemic.",,
"Great course. Interesting topics and a greater appreciation for the difficulty and complexity of economics. If you are afraid to take this class because you think it doesn't apply to you, or you have nothing to contribute, do not let that stop you. We are all engaged with economics in one way or another and it probably applies to your other studies in more ways than one.",,
Do the readings as you go!,,
"It's a bad class. Plain and simple. If you want to advance in econ, you have to take it, but bad class nonetheless. not taught well and you are tested on an insane amount of info that isn't covered",,
keep up with readings and make sure you take good notes on them because the test focuses a lot on those details.,,
Macroecon is a good course for learning how economics works and to get general econ knowledge. Would reccomend reading the Economist articles and doing PSETS at McGraw.,,
"This class is a lot more qualitative than micro, so a lot of assignments will ask you to explain concepts and events rather than to solve problems. The readings can be a little dry, but definitely make sure you keep up with them, otherwise the problem sets can be challenging.",,
Take this course! It's not super demanding and it is very fun.,,
The exams are much more difficult than anticipated. Know all of the readings well.,,
"I absolutely loved taking this course with Professor Bogan. She is so inspirational, and I have learned so much from this class. Being in Prof. Bogan's class has made me super interested in economics, and it makes me even more excited to pursue my major in economics and to just be aware of current events and how they're affecting our economy. Furthermore, the class is taught extremely well-- especially because it is well organized, and Prof. Bogan and the preceptors work so well as a team and are good at communicating and managing the class together. They really want you to excel in the course. This course stimulated my intellectual curiosity and I just LEARNED A LOT!!! Favorite class at Princeton so far. (It is so sad that Professor Bogan is leaving, but I know that so many students have been inspired by her teaching, and we will miss her a lot.)",,
If Rafael is a preceptor SWITCH INTO HIS PRECEPT. He was a lifesaver.,,
do the readings,,
This course really depends on the professor (and preceptor) you get.,,
"If you must take this course, I'm sorry. If you're doing this for the distribution rerquirement, take ECO100 instead.",,
Take it if you want.,,
Go to office hours,,
"This is a basic course for Econ majors, so you'd have to take it regardless. The information taught is highly relevant, and prof Bogan made a clear effort to apply our education to current events. However, lectures seemed to be monotonous at times, and after switching to virtual classes, we were just sent these extended slides to read and take notes on. As it is, the course assigned a ton of reading- articles, official documents, and textbook chapters. It could have been cut down.Also, the course problem sets were worded in a very confusing manner, where many questions seemed to have multiple answers> I was not the only one who experienced this, and the same issue applied to exams, which is even worse. The information is relevant and interesting and the course workload is more than manageable. The only downsides are the lecture format and the trickly problem set questions that students face week to week.",,
"Please don't take this course unless you absolutely have to for your major.  The material covered in lecture was completely different from the textbook, which was completely different from the articles/packet readings, which were completely different from precept.  I was so lost the whole time and had no idea what to expect on the midterm/final.  This course brought me pain",,
I would advise future Princeton students to be prepared to work but learn a lot about the economic world around you.,,
"Take this course! It's not a requirement for Woodrow Wilson School majors, but I think it should me. The course poses interesting questions and provides the tools to tackle policy problems knowledgeably.",,
"Go to tutoring, it is more helpful than the course help.",,
"Enjoy it and go to lectures, by keeping up with this class, you will definitely like the class and get a good grade.",,
"Do not take this as your SA (as I did :/ ). There are far more interesting SAs to take and ones that won't stress you out. Maybe if you have taken AP Macro or IB Macro or your'e just super interested, things would be different, but if you haven't I would stay far away.",,
Take it to understand more about the world around you.,,
very informational and worth taking to learn a good amount about the basics of the macro economy,,
Take it with Blinder.,,
Recommend and definitely work together on problem. sets,,
Do it. It wont hurt you unless you put in no effort. -A guy who had never taken any economics before,,
"Bogan's lectures weren't the best. They seemed to stray off topic a lot, and didn't really explain key concepts well. The slides are also not really the most helpful.The preceptors really saved the day, and were super helpful with understanding concepts and preparing for psets and exams. Pretty much all my learning for this course happened during precepts and preceptor office hours. In terms of the actual content, though - I'd say it's a pretty good course. You learn a lot of basic general knowledge about the economy - inflation, interest rates, income, borrowing and lending, international trade etc. Good stuff to know.",,
It is possible to get by without really understand the material but you will enjoy it less,,
definitely take this course! so much useful information for any career field.,,
good class,,
Definitely go to all the lectures and do the economist readings they are usually very interesting.,,
Go to lecture and pay attention.,,
"Do not take this course with Bogan! She is really an awful instructor, very unclear, hard to follow during lectures and more than anything, she's just mean. I emailed her with questions and I received a rude response that just made me feel really bad about how I was doing in the class. The test format is very high stakes and difficult to pass. Honestly, this class experience has really soured me on the economics department as a whole and has me rethinking if I'd actually like to pursue econ.",,
"The grading is heavily dependent on how you do on the final. The topics we talked about were extremely relevant to the world today, and thus were very engaging.",,
Only take for department need.,,
Stay up to date with the readings!,,
"I think it should be mandatory. Really liked this class and it gives a great overview of how a lot of the world works. Super easy PDF, I took it graded and had a surprisingly not easy time.",,
Take it! I liked Bogan's teaching style. Not a very challenging course and fun to learn about macro.,,
Only take this class if you have to. The material is interesting at times but not particularly well taught. Precept is where you'll learn most of what you need to do psets so be sure to pay attention (they're also required). There are definitely more interesting SA's that one could take.,,
Go to McGraw study hall and office hours for PSETs.  Just memorize the big details to do well on exams.,,
Don't miss lecture and stay on top of readings since they will be on the midterm and final.,,
Keep up with readings and think about discussion questions.,,
"It's very important to learn this information. I found it fascinating. Make sure it's taught by a relatable, young teacher.",,
Use the lecture slides while doing the problem sets.,,
"Lectures are more big picture, psets are not always representative of what is discussed, but lectures are critical for overall understanding. Go to precepts if math is weird.",,
follow the readings,,
