Almost every time there's a graph on the lecture slides (which you can imagine is pretty often), he has to stop and remind the class that he's colorblind, and can't distinguish the different lines on the graph.  Ok that's fine.  But then he has to ask someone which line is which.  Let me remind you this happens almost every lecture.  And then he's shocked when the line he thought was red is actually green.  As if he can't just change his OWN slides to make the lines colors that he can see!  I think he does it to be funny but it's really just distracting.  Apart from that, for material that is more difficult, he puts an asterisk on that slide so that you can "go home and study it closer" instead of him clarifying it in lecture.  Overall the textbook and precept will probably be your best bet for learning.  To be fair I never went to Professor Farber's office hours so he might be quite helpful in person.  </div>

However, TA's cannot explicitly help you with the homework until after it is turned in. Before that, the guidance they give is a little vague and could create misunderstandings when doing the homework. It would be nice if solutions were posted sooner. Lectures were not really about the homework, but, eh, what can you expect; Farber does a good job incorporating the "real world" into economics, however, and talks a lot about some stuff that is good to know but sometimes not very helpful on exams. Lectures usually begin with some news story and slowly progresses onto the day's topics from there.</div>

The preceptors are all wonderful and knowledgable and most learning will take place in precept. Most of the drawbacks from this course definitely stem from Farber himself. He is often sidetracked, confused about the relevance of his own assignments, and not very good at explaining things. However, success in this class is feasible mainly because the preceptors pick up his slack. If you need to take this class, try to take it with a different professor because it will probably go smoother. If not, don't worry too much because it is still very doable. If you are able to do well on the PSETs, you will likely do well on exams. Plenty of help is available (The preceptors are very thorough in their responses to questions and McGraw is a great resource).</div>

And OH BOY was I wrong. This was absolutely horrible. Farber cannot teach anything and he is atrocious at explaining concepts. During a review session when we asked to explain a problem on the practice exam, he could not solve it and gave us the wrong method to solve it. Absolutely horrible. Do not take this class with Farber. I should have waited another semester to take this class with someone else. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">tl;dr: Avoid at all costsWow. I'm incredibly mad at myself for wasting my time taking this course. The only positive experience I had in this course was that my preceptor was a very nice person. Everything else was terrible- problem sets, lectures, and all.Things started going downhill pretty much immediately. In our first lecture, Professor Farber spent a ton of time telling us how important economics was, how we were going to learn a lot in this course, and how he, as a labor economist, is extremely qualified to be teaching us. He also managed to discuss at length the facts that he is color blind and that he does not like Trump. This was pretty good foreshadowing for every lecture that followed. Professor Farber would spend the first few minutes showing us a news story he said was related to what we were learning in class. I don't think students really gained anything from this, since we usually hadn't learned anything in the previous lecture because a) he did a lousy job of explaining things and b) his lecture slides were so poorly written they managed to confuse us more. Next, he would launch into said poor explanation of whatever we were supposed to be learning. I'm pretty sure I lost brain cells whenever I heard him speak. The slides would invariably include some multicolored graph, at which point the professor would spend at least two minutes telling the class that he is color blind and can't read the figure. Seriously, if you can't read the graph, why did you put it in your lecture slides?? I am forced to conclude that either he was too lazy to write his own lecture slides, or that he thinks it's funny to talk about his colorblindness in every class and so he does it on purpose. Anyway, after that time waster, he would go on "teaching". At some point, a question would be asked, to which the professor would respond by telling the class that he's a labor economist and is therefore extremely qualified to be teaching us. Like, dude, we know you're a professor, you don't have to mention it every five seconds. The last hallmark of these colossal catastrophes of lectures was at least five minutes spent telling the class that he doesn't like Trump and that Trump is an idiot. Professor Farber's politics are up to him, but I'm coming to lecture to learn economics, not to listen to you talk about your personal political views, and honestly, who cares? To cap it all off, Professor Farber would mark off the more difficult slides and intentionally not explain them in lecture, because he "didn't want to spend time in lecture on particularly dense lecture slides", which is utterly backwards; obviously, you should be spending your time making sure students understand the more difficult parts of the material, not the easy parts! Then at the end of every lecture, he would lament that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material he'd planned to teach that day, so we'd have to review the last ? - ? (depending on the day) of the lecture slides on our own. Obviously there isn't enough time in lecture, since you spent half of it telling students that economics is really important, inflating your ego by talking about your credentials, telling students that you're colorblind, and announcing your political views to the room.Of course, I should probably be very happy that Professor Farber didn't teach all of the material. When it came time to do each problem set, I would read each question, and immediately google search the topic. I ended up learning most of the material, from Wikipedia, Investopedia, or ACDC Economics youtube videos. In fact, the more I relied on the professor to teach me a topic, the worse I ended up understanding it. Naturally, I stopped going to lecture, since it was a colossal waste of my time. But don't you worry, I had to waste my time on these problem sets, so the professor still got to waste several hours  ... [more]</div>

Farber can be a funny guy and catch you with some nice moments, but this boomer sometimes gets caught in his own world. The PSets are hell toward the end of the year, but working with friends makes it more manageable. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. We didn't use it at all, and Farber's powerpoints are much more tailored to learning the course than the wordy textbook. None of my friends and I bought it and the course went fine. All that aside, I did enjoy moments in the course and Farber as a person. Also, you'll love Stephanie as a preceptor because she is an absolute ANGEL.</div>

The professor speaks in a clear manner, but he reads off his powerpoint slides, so lectures aren't really necessary. It's not exactly boring but also not super exciting. I'd recommend this course if you want to have a basic knowledge of ECO 100, and as someone who took both ECO 101 and ECO 100, this course focuses more on economics material whereas ECO 101 also integrated current events. Precepts were very informative. The course is easy if you're P/D/Fing and mildly challenging if you're aiming for an A. </div>

Read the textbook as it really makes up for what you don't always learn in lectures. Don't skip precepts as they are critical for understanding what may be misunderstood in lecture. Don't fall behind either as concepts build off of what you've already learned. It's also very useful to have at least some basic calculus to take this course as Professor Farber kind of expects a little bit of understanding on derivatives.</div>

ALSO DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN ECONOMICS. Not only will this course kill any desire for you to learn economics, it will cause your GPA to tank. By far, the worst class I have ever taken at Princeton, as my peers were as clueless as I was when filling out problem sets and studying for the final. It got to a point where I cried in a dining hall when someone asked me how this class was going. The only reason I didn't drop or PDF this class was because I thought I needed it for Woody Woo, a major I am now not considering (at which point the deadline had already passed to drop). I think the only good thing about this course is that it taught me to be resilient in the face of constant, gruelling failure, and let me know that I absolutely am not going to be doing any economic study in the future.
