Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Try your best to understand psets every week. Go to prof and preceptor office hours- they are very willing to help with psets and answer questions.,,
Great class! Very well run. Engaging lectures and fair exams. Preceptor Safonov is fantastic - sign up for his precept if possible.,,
Go to office hours. So helpful. Professor Chassang really cares about his students.,,
"This course is quite difficult and requires a decent amount of comfort with math, but it gets quite rewarding and significantly more interesting towards the end. It had a really nice setup over Zoom. Prof. Chassang sometimes appears a bit harsh in lectures, but he is overall very supportive and friendly. Pay attention in the lectures (that's what really matters for this course) and make sure you understand the psets you submit. The slides and the notation on the is at times a bit confusing so be mindful of that. Attend office hours and if you're struggling make sure to content prof. Chassang and discuss it: he really cares about your performance in the course and will always put a lot of effort outside of class to help you.",,
"Great class, difficult exams if you're not prepared and knowledgeable of main concepts",,
coding involved but mostly problem sets are manageable,,
"As long as you go to all of the lectures and internalize the problem sets, you should be fine.",,
"If you have a strong microeconomics background, you will like this class, but if you don't and this class is not a requirement for your major, I wouldn't recommend taking it.",,
Ask questions! The preceptors are super helpful.,,
"Course was very stressful because its structure and content was unclear. Chassang is a good guy who cares about his students, but the course organization was pretty rough. Solutions were never released for the problem sets and Chassang would never clearly answer questions in class but rather write confusing mathematical proofs that no one understood. The course ended up being fine but was stressful due to its nebulous organization",,
"Very hard material, very math based, but everyone cares for you and will work hard to help you succeed. Chassang is an incredible guy who wants the best for his students",,
Don't take this course unless you have to.,,
"Required for Econ Majors, so study up.",,
Take with a different professor.,,
"Professor Chassang is actually pretty considerate and nice. Always open to answering questions - but beware he can get impatient at times. But, to be completely honest, he does care about whether or not his students understand the material, although his pset scheduling was terrible. Overall, a decent class.",,
"This class has gotten pretty low reviews in the past, but I found it to be a good class and not too challenging. Definitely attend all the lectures since there aren't readings (if Professor Chassang is teaching). Prof Chassang does a great job with this class. Psets are very straight-forward and are great practice for exams. Good class for an SA requirement.",,
"Some concepts are very interesting, so classes are nice to attend. Assignments, however, are extremely boring.",,
only do it if you need it for the econ departmental. it's not super hard though once you get the hang of it.,,
don't take unless required,,
Not much of a change from eco100,,
