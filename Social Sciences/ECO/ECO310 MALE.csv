"I came into this course without having taken ECO 100 (I tested out with AP Micro) and found it manageable, but did have to put in more work than I would have liked. The lectures were long and not that helpful--unfortunately it took me until the end of the semester to realize that the textbook/notes packet was much easier to learn from--but the precepts were very well-run. It is a pretty interesting course, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it unless you need it for a departmental or some other requirement.",,
Would not recommend this course to anyone trying to actually learn about how to use economics in the real world -- course content was a bunch of theorems and learning how to apply them in specific contexts. I don't feel that I've come out of this with a better intuition for how the individuals act with respect to economics. Professor Urgun is a super cool guy but lectures are very dull and the course material is hard to digest due to the writing styles and abundant typos. I went into this course with pretty high expectations but was definitely let down and feel that I've wasted my time.,,
meh,,
GO TO PRECEPT!!! Lecture is not as important.,,
Do all the psets.,,
"Everyone says this class is easy. I would say that it is easier than other math-track Econ departmental. It, however, is not an easy class. Be prepared to put in the work to be able to formalize logic and apply concepts to a variety of scenarios. This is the kind of class where if you put in the work, it will show, but study as you go. Don't cram at the end.",,
"Pretty easy workload, really short problem sets every other week, two get dropped. You don't have to think about the class a whole lot on weeks without homework. The downside to this is that there are almost no practice problems and the homeworks don't prepare you for the exams super well. Your performance in the course is much more dependent on math knowledge than econ knowledge. Also, even though you can use AP credit to skip ECO100/101, I think the instructors assume that everyone has taken those classes at Princeton. They would sometimes reference definitions/formulas that I guess were covered in the Princeton version of the class but definitely not in AP. Not a huge hinderance but something to be aware of early on.",,
"Can Urgun is nice but not a very good lecturer. Could barely see what he was writing on board and it didn't helpp much with exams or homework. Definitely attend precepts because those are helpful. Overall, not the best course and didn't find very interesting but took it as departmental. Workload isn't too crazy because psets are short but this bites you in the butt when it's exam time.",,
Straightforward class! Lectures are mathematically-heavy but precept is extremely useful.,,
Kirill Rudov is a great preceptor,,
"Every single week of this semester, I wished that I had taken ECO 300 instead of 310. Either wait until the spring to take this class or take 300. Lectures with Professor Urgun were so, so bad, the worst I have ever had excepting ORF 245. Professor Urgun tries to be funny but it just ends up being cringe, he reads off of the slides most of the time, and on the off chance he decides to write on the board it is USELESS. He writes so lightly, his handwriting is so bad, and his steps for problem solving are so unintelligible that it was not even worth paying attention. Half of the room could not even see what he was writing. And no matter what we were talking about, the way he explained things was FAR more complicated than ever it needed to be - I know this because my preceptor (Kwok Hao-Lee, highly recommend) explained it better every time. Please, if lectures are important for your learning, or you do not want your time to be wasted, take another course or just learn the content on your own. Precept was really great, though, and I did learn quite a bit in those 50 minutes each week. Also, the content in the first half of the semester was excruciatingly boring, and this is coming from someone who loved ECO 100 and enjoyed doing the work for that class. It just seemed uninspired and useless, though I rather enjoyed game theory in the second half of the semester. The midterm was hard but doable, and the final was honestly on the easier side. But you are going to need to grind study problems because the problem sets are biweekly, 1-2 hours in length, and do NOT prepare you for the exams. It was so frustrating because the course did not hold you accountable for the material at all until the midterm, which may be good for those looking for an easy 5th, but I found it to be so much more frustrating than expected. I would have preferred a more consistent workload that did not necessitate insane cramming before the midterm and final, because the homework was just way too easy. This course is a dream for the very mathematically inclined math, physics, and ORFE majors, but if you are like me and you actually wanted to learn about economics, take ECO 300.",,
Don't take it unless you have to.,,
"Can is a nice guy and he tries really hard to be funny and to get students to like him. But if you want to be able to hear or see anything he does in lecture, be sure to sit in the front 3 rows, or else you might as well not go to lectures. Take when he's not teaching.",,
Don't take this class with Prof Urgun!,,
I think this is a good class to fulfill a distributional req or as an intro to Math-track Econ. Just make sure to practice as many questions as possible before taking any test and to go to office hours for psets (especially the instructor's office hours) and you should be fine.,,
"This class is annoyingly hard: it's a very low time commitment, but the way it was taught made it hard. I took it as an ORF distribution req, and the math majors basically kill the curve for everyone else. Lectures are not really helpful; Can is knowledgable but his material is way more theory-based than what is necessary to succeed in the class; the second-half of the semester the lecture slides were basically useless and it got harder to see Can's writing on the board. Just go to precepts where you'll actually learn the material that will help you do well in class.",,
Don't be scared of the heavy mathematical notations. The ideas behind them are really straightforward and once you get them the psets are also easy. Tbh if you want to get more exposure to basic economic concepts ECO100 is probably better.,,
Take it if you enjoy the topic but or else you might get bored easily,,
"Midterm and final pretty hard, but not a lot of work other than that.",,
"I'm scared people are going to give Can flak in these reviews, but I truly do think highly of him. He's relatable, funny, smart (goes without saying) and an engaging lecturer. He knows when to stop lecturing off the slides and give his own intuitive take on the topics. His accent is present sometimes, and it's hard to hear sometimes, but other than that you can really get a lot out of this class. On the last point, you get in as much as you put out. If you want to learn a lot about individual decision making and utility and game theory, then you can truly learn a lot. If you don't, you can do a shockingly little amount of work in this course and do very well. The best way I've heard this course described is as a ""6 day course"" if you want it to be: 4 days for 4 psets, 1 day for the midterm, 1 day for the final. You can do this, but don't. Get something out of the class, it's worthwhile if you pay attention. The precepts are as standard as they can get; instead of theoretical, generalized statements, you drill practice problems. Both preceptors are nice, but there's a limit to how much you can get out of the precepts if you already know the material. It's not gonna make you understand it any better.Overall, I think this course is worth taking ONLY IF you are truly interested in the material and are committed to learning. It's not worth it otherwise, you're going to give up halfway through the semester and regret taking it.The workload is insanely light, you have to do next to no work for this class at all.",,
Get Kwok Lee as a preceptor! He is so helpful and very willing to help you understand things you don't understand.,,
Good,,
Go to precept!!! It's the most help and support you'll get in the course.,,
"The course is difficult and the lectures are a bit hard to be engaged in, but the material is actually pretty entertaining, and professor Urgun wants everyone to be as passionate as he, which is refreshing.",,
take it!,,
"Doable for a student w/o any econ background, but prepare for lots of abstract ideas that can be difficult to wrap your mind around! Very light course load (6 short psets, 2 dropped), but you will need to study for exams.",,
"If Can is teaching it, prepare to fall asleep in lecture. You will learn nothing; just go to precept. You will learn how to comprehend the material there. Also, do the midterm prep questions because the problem sets and the midterm are NOTHING alike.",,
"If you're looking to get the finance certificate, there's really no need to take 310. 310 is pretty difficult if you get behind, and I don't really feel like I got that much out of the course a semester later. For ORF majors, I would say ECO310 is substantially more difficult than ORF245, but still easier than MAT201/202. I would say take a COS course (226, 217) as a departmental before ECO310.",,
If you're a maths major you should have no difficulty with this course whatsoever.,,
Class is low work but tests are very challenging,,
This class is not super straightforward by any means. Your grade usually turns out okay if you put in time and study a lot for the exams but there is not much help from the lectures. The practice problem sets before exams were nice. I wouldn't take this class unless you want a distribution requirement. Its not that easy and you don't learn that much.,,
Take this if you have some background with proofs or are just interested in not starting in a 100 level econ class.,,
This is a decent class with a lot of intriguing concepts.,,
I took it over 300 and don't regret. It teaches a few very important mathematical concepts and approaches. Assignments and both the midterm and final were fair and representative of the material level in precepts and problem sets.,,
"Don't take this if you are finance certificate-ing. Just take 300. Attend Precept, don't worry about lectures.",,
"Took because I wanted to do the finance cert and thought I might want to be ORF. This class reassured me I do not want to do those things. Material is presented in a very verbose, undigestable manner with hard to follow lectures. Exam problems are way harder than your homeworks(although those are very reasonable). This class is a very theoretical approach to microecon. This doesn't mean it's incomprehensible but it just means that you feel like you don't learn anything tangible. Take eco300 unless you are ORF, in which this is the class that counts for credit.",,
"It can get abstract with proofs, but showing an understanding through sentences is equivalent to a rigorous proof, thankfully.",,
