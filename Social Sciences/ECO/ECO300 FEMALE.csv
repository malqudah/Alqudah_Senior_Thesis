Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Much better taught than ECO101,,
"It isn't the best class you'll take at Princeton. But for people who have to take this class, I strongly recommend taking it with Professor Wilson. She explains things very clearly and her lecture notes are easy to follow. Yes, she's a bit boring, but to be fair, I don't really think anyone can make this material interesting. This class has been rated pretty poorly, but I think it's not so much her fault as it is the content itself being dry. Professor Wilson is also a nice person and she's willing to help you out if you reach out.",,
Take it with Professor Wilson! Both her and the preceptor (Lee) were extremely willing to help and provided consistently high level of instruction throughout the semester.,,
"Probably the easiest of the WWS economics core reqs with Wilson teaching. But just like all other econ classes, the content is mind-numbingly boring.",,
"An extension of ECO100, with a little more game theory and other concepts. Not math heavy, easier than ECO310.",,
"Although the course taught you the basic microeconomic material you need to know, the material, in my opinion, is very dry and boring. It feels like you're just somehow learning to apply calculus to word problems that do not represent the real world. Although the material was well taught as in you learned the stuff you need to learn how to do, the lack of connection to the real world was really disappointing for me as this is an economics class. Although this is a pretty easy class, I would only take it if you need to. There are much more intellectually stimulating classes out there.",,
"This class was fairly taught, the professor was nice and the problem sets overlapped with the material in class and precepts. I feel the class got better as it went online as you could speed up the lectures to get the lecture done in under 1 hour with no effect on the learning",,
"If Professor Wilson is teaching, don't miss the opportunity! She teaches wonderfully and her dog, Mavi, is always a treat. Course material can be challenging at times but the resources are there to clarify doubts you have. Just stay on top of the lectures and problem set material (and review sheets!) and you'll be fine. Really enjoyed myself :)",,
Take it,,
Be sure to keep up and read the notes thoroughly in order to do the problem sets.,,
Take with Prof Wilson! She's tough but a very good prof,,
Ask questions in precept and make sure you understand the problem sets well before going into the exam.,,
Go to lectures and you will be just fine.,,
Use the lecture notes during psets and pay attention in lecture to get down the material. Work with classmates on psets.,,
"For an ECO core class, not bad at all! Professor Wilson is so kind and genuinely cares about her students, and she is super knowledgeable about what she teaches. Lecture can get a little slow/repetitive at times, but it's actually really helpful for reviewing material and really making sure you understand what's going on. Would strongly recommend printing and annotating the lecture slides, and form pset groups to work through the bi-weekly psets.",,
I would take this course over ECO310 if Andrea Wilson is teaching it. She is a good professor and generously curves the class while also being easy to reach.,,
"Took it for the woody woo econ requirement and have no real complaints. It sounds like there are no great options for the rec but the class was manageable and well-taught so I would recommend. Exams were hard but fair and as a non math person, I was able to get the pretty simple math by studying a decent amount.",,
"I took this after skipping eco100 (I had an AP Micro 5) and didn't find it to be excessively difficult. It's very manageable if you pay attention in lecture/read the lecture slides to make sure you understand the content. Other than that, it's a pretty light workload.",,
The course if not very difficult so long as you actually go to lecture and follow along,,
"Definitely take this class if you want to fulfill WWS requirement. It's very easy to understand, not hard on the math, and Prof Wilson is extremely kind and understanding and does her best to make sure you are understand all the material! It's a great class.",,
"This course by Andrea has become a much better departmental than in the past. She is always available to answer questions and lectures are generally straightforward. However, more practice tests and more tests/projects to gauge the course material would have been helpful.",,
"This class is a departmental, so most people are taking it because they have to. Professor Wilson is a good professor and she is very willing to work with you. The midterm was much harder than the final, and there were more resources to prepare for the final. The psets were relevant to the lectuers and while the exams were harder, they were just applications of the material, so using psets and practice exams really helps.  Lectures were overall fine, but you do have to keep reviewing the material because there are a lot of small specifics that are really important for understanding in the course.",,
"If you have to take this course, it isn't the end of the world. You'll do just fine as long as you use your resources - Dr. Wilson, the preceptors, etc.",,
I really enjoyed the material in this course and Prof. Wilson is a great lecturer! The course load was relatively light and the content is very well taught.,,
go to lecture and review your notes. ask for help etc etc,,
"It is very repetitive of Intro to Micro, and honestly easier.",,
Pretty straightforward course. Going to lecture not necessary; slides are self-explanatory and sufficient for psets.,,
"Go to precept, study the lecture slides, and practice as much as you can. There are challenging parts, but overall it is a very fair course.",,
"Get a group of people who are willing and able to collaborate. This course can be done without help from friends, but more minds on the psets and exam prep have made my experience much smoother.",,
Work hard! The psets really reflect the topics that will on the final and midterm,,
"If you're taking this course it's probably because you have to for ECO or WWS. Prof Wilson is a better lecturer than many of the Econ faculty. Dan is also a great preceptor! There were only 5 psets which was nice, but exam Qs were often unrelated to the psets and much harder. I PDFed, but I'd say it's pretty hard to get an A-range if you're not a particularily quantitative person like myself. Make sure you have a strong micro and math foundation before walking in. Also, make sure to have a study buddy! I didn't, which made it tougher. At the end of the day, its standard micro which can be pretty dry.",,
Only take it if you have to.,,
I took this as a departmental prerequisite. I found the class moderately engaging and not overly difficult. I wouldn't take unless it was a departmental.,,
ONLY take this class with Wilson and DO NOT TAKE THE WWS ECO CLASS,,
"If you're looking for a WWS econ core requirement, take this course! The workload is super manageable ? there are only five problem sets, plus a midterm and final. It's not the most fascinating content, but the psets were pretty straightforward and the final curve for the class was really generous. Sometimes the administrative part of the course felt a tad chaotic, but overall, Professor Wilson was incredibly accessible and had the students' best interests in mind. Dan is also an amazing preceptor and his office hours were super helpful! If you put in the work you'll definitely be fine.",,
"For me, this course was better than WWS 300. I shopped both ECO 300 and WWS 300 and though WWS 300 was supposed to be easier, from what I remember ECO 300 was taught in such a way that it ended up being easier. (I took it with Professor Andrea Wilson.)",,
