Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Go to McGraw for psets and work with other people,,
There is a decent amount of work each work with the p-sets and it is important that you stay on top of important topics so that you do not get behind for the midterm and final.,,
"Not my favorite class, but it wasn't terrible. Workload is definitely manageable, and the basic concepts aren't too hard to grasp. Lectures and problem sets can be confusing and need improvement.",,
Always go to precept and always invest in the PSETs. The PSETs are key to understanding the material and preparing for the midterm and final.,,
"It's a solid course, but the lectures have some room for improvement.",,
"I would say take this class but be willing to put in time and do problems over the year, cramming will not work.",,
It gives a good overview of micro.,,
I thought the course overall was pretty good. For the most part it is what I expected for an intro course.,,
"-I don't know how economics as a major works, but if you're able to, you should avoid taking this class with Professor Farber.  Almost every time there's a graph on the lecture slides (which you can imagine is pretty often), he has to stop and remind the class that he's colorblind, and can't distinguish the different lines on the graph.  Ok that's fine.  But then he has to ask someone which line is which.  Let me remind you this happens almost every lecture.  And then he's shocked when the line he thought was red is actually green.  As if he can't just change his OWN slides to make the lines colors that he can see!  I think he does it to be funny but it's really just distracting.  Apart from that, for material that is more difficult, he puts an asterisk on that slide so that you can ""go home and study it closer"" instead of him clarifying it in lecture.  Overall the textbook and precept will probably be your best bet for learning.  To be fair I never went to Professor Farber's office hours so he might be quite helpful in person.",,
Keep on top of material.,,
Good easy class for those looking to get into Economics.,,
"This class is a fairly easy, but boring way to get an SA requirement out of the way. If you are majoring in econ, even if you don't have AP micro credit, just try weasel your way into 300 or 310. This class just isn't mind blowing or life changing in any way like a lot of classes at Princeton can be. I wish I had taken a more interesting class my first semester at this school.",,
"Very good course, need to pay attention to the slideshows to understand the material.",,
If you like economics or are looking for an SA without a lot of work this is a good class.,,
If you wanna take this course be ready to re read notes a lot. Overall not that hard of a course.,,
Study from the problem sets and lecture slides. Textbook helps clear up content but you can probably get ideas from youtube. The preceptors and McGraw help with problem sets too!,,
yes,,
I would advise that students review material before coming to lectures because lectures aren't the best introduction to concepts but act as a good reinforcer.,,
"Lectures are often not super clear so frequently requires a lot of time on your own to restudy the material and really understand it -- be prepared to put in this time. Go to office hours if you have any confusion or questions at all (especially with the preceptors -- they are super helpful and willing to help)!! And take advantage of McGraw on the weekly psets... it really helps!!! Overall, you should expect and be prepared to have to put in a substantial amount of time and effort into this class if you want to do well in it.",,
"This course is aggressively average, but ok if you just need an SA.",,
Go to the lectures.,,
"From McGraw to office hours, the amount of resources provided is no joke. However, TA's cannot explicitly help you with the homework until after it is turned in. Before that, the guidance they give is a little vague and could create misunderstandings when doing the homework. It would be nice if solutions were posted sooner. Lectures were not really about the homework, but, eh, what can you expect; Farber does a good job incorporating the ""real world"" into economics, however, and talks a lot about some stuff that is good to know but sometimes not very helpful on exams. Lectures usually begin with some news story and slowly progresses onto the day's topics from there.",,
It teaches a lot of useful information for understanding  the basics of micro.,,
Be prepared to take advantage of office hours and help from peers on psets. The course isn't too difficult but you should check in with the lecturer/preceptors to make sure you are understanding the concepts correctly.,,
"This course gives some useful conceptual understanding of microeconomics, however the graded material is very math and graph focused, so the course shifts in that direction quickly. It was not amazing, but the subject matter is so important that everyone should take it",,
"It's Econ 100.  Take it if you need to, don't if you don't.  It's not going to be your favorite, it's not super fascinating, but it's great if you just want to do your pset, do your exam, and leave.  You'll learn the economics and it won't be terribly painful, at worst it is boring.  I would say don't come in expecting much, do your psets, take the practice examination and go to office hours if you have questions, and don't buy the book.  It's never used or discussed, just look something up on Khan Academy if you have questions.",,
It's a really interesting class! Take it if you have any interest in economics or finance. Not good for an easy extra class though.,,
Keep up with lectures,,
Do not take it if you don't have to,,
"Don't take this class with Farber if you don't want to hear him make unnecessary references to slavery that are borderline racist. His lectures are not the best, and if you can, wait to take ECO 100 with literally any other professor if you can. I'm sure he's nice outside of lecture, but he is not a good professor.",,
Go to mcgraw,,
go to precept and mcgraw on weekends.,,
Challenging but worth it!,,
"Stay on top of the course as one topic builds on another, don't get behind. But very interesting class.",,
"This is a solid class. I didn't find it overly difficult but was also not able to breeze by. I'd recommend attending lectures and reading (it's really not that big of an ask), and while Prof. Farber's lectures are relatively mediocre, they're bad like a vocal minority might lead you to believe. The material is good knowledge to have and my preceptor, Max (and the other two who I went to office hours with) work hard to educate students as well. I'm planning on majoring in Econ and this didn't dissuade me nor did it get me super fired up about the major.",,
Review the notes before class and attend McGraw study sessions.,,
go to lectures,,
Don't take it with Farber.,,
"Please wait to take this class with another professor. Farber is very kind, however, he lacks the ability to connect and relate with students who have had very little exposure to economics. He has reached a point where he cannot understand why students are confused. If you have to take this for a distribution requirement, take it under another professor. This class probably would be decent to PDF.",,
Very good basis of economics. Start the problem sets early and don't get behind in not understanding concepts.,,
I recommend other students take this course.,,
A lot of self-studying-don't rely on lectures or precept to learn the difficult concepts.,,
Lectures are a waste of time.,,
Make sure to attend office hours if you have questions.,,
"It provides a good overview of the topic is generally good.  It is not too difficult.  If you take it, MAKE SURE George is your preceptor; he is a necessity and the best.",,
go to precept because you will get the most out of this class,,
Material is okay but Prof. Farber is not the most apt at clarifying and explaining. Preceptors and the textbook will be a big help.,,
"Great class. Precepts are fun... they are graded so you have to attend but you will be fine without them. Lectures are not graded. You don't have to go. It can be helpful. MCGRAW OFFICE HOURS FOR THE PSET as well as any other office hours are a must..and a big help. Otherwise this is a solid class and if you are interested in the material you will like it. I am not an Econ major, I am COS and I really enjoy it. Also.... for the snakes..this is a good class lol.",,
"Since it is an introductory course, many topics are covered throughout the semester. It is hard for the professor to explain every topic clearly. The problem sets can be difficult.",,
Course is fine and manageable but just dont take it with Farber. Just wait an extra semester if you can and take it with someone else. The confusion on problem set throughout the year is not worth it. Honestly watching youtube videos on econ is better than going to his lectures...you will learn more,,
"Only take if you need for a requirement, I left the course feeling as if I had been robbed of my proper education of Microeconomics. The course material could be really compelling, too bad it wasn't taught well.",,
"The quality of this course was mediocre at best. The preceptors are all wonderful and knowledgable and most learning will take place in precept. Most of the drawbacks from this course definitely stem from Farber himself. He is often sidetracked, confused about the relevance of his own assignments, and not very good at explaining things. However, success in this class is feasible mainly because the preceptors pick up his slack. If you need to take this class, try to take it with a different professor because it will probably go smoother. If not, don't worry too much because it is still very doable. If you are able to do well on the PSETs, you will likely do well on exams. Plenty of help is available (The preceptors are very thorough in their responses to questions and McGraw is a great resource).",,
A lot harder than you think. Spend a lot of time on the problem sets and reviewing slides.,,
Lecture is not very useful. Do PSets in advance,,
Take advantage of your preceptor's office hours because they are one of your most important resources. Also go to McGraw to collaborate on problem sets because they provide a lot of help too.,,
Find any other way to fulfill your pre-recs. It's not worth it unless you truly want to go into Econ.,,
"If you are thinking about taking this course, you must be willing to do a lot of work on your own to thoroughly understand the material. I believe that this class is very dependent on the professor, so look into them before choosing the course.",,
Attend as many lectures and precepts as possible.,,
"When I first saw the course rating of Farber's course, I thought to myself, no way a Princeton course could be that bad. And OH BOY was I wrong. This was absolutely horrible. Farber cannot teach anything and he is atrocious at explaining concepts. During a review session when we asked to explain a problem on the practice exam, he could not solve it and gave us the wrong method to solve it. Absolutely horrible. Do not take this class with Farber. I should have waited another semester to take this class with someone else.",,
"tl;dr: Avoid at all costsWow. I'm incredibly mad at myself for wasting my time taking this course. The only positive experience I had in this course was that my preceptor was a very nice person. Everything else was terrible- problem sets, lectures, and all.Things started going downhill pretty much immediately. In our first lecture, Professor Farber spent a ton of time telling us how important economics was, how we were going to learn a lot in this course, and how he, as a labor economist, is extremely qualified to be teaching us. He also managed to discuss at length the facts that he is color blind and that he does not like Trump. This was pretty good foreshadowing for every lecture that followed. Professor Farber would spend the first few minutes showing us a news story he said was related to what we were learning in class. I don't think students really gained anything from this, since we usually hadn't learned anything in the previous lecture because a) he did a lousy job of explaining things and b) his lecture slides were so poorly written they managed to confuse us more. Next, he would launch into said poor explanation of whatever we were supposed to be learning. I'm pretty sure I lost brain cells whenever I heard him speak. The slides would invariably include some multicolored graph, at which point the professor would spend at least two minutes telling the class that he is color blind and can't read the figure. Seriously, if you can't read the graph, why did you put it in your lecture slides?? I am forced to conclude that either he was too lazy to write his own lecture slides, or that he thinks it's funny to talk about his colorblindness in every class and so he does it on purpose. Anyway, after that time waster, he would go on ""teaching"". At some point, a question would be asked, to which the professor would respond by telling the class that he's a labor economist and is therefore extremely qualified to be teaching us. Like, dude, we know you're a professor, you don't have to mention it every five seconds. The last hallmark of these colossal catastrophes of lectures was at least five minutes spent telling the class that he doesn't like Trump and that Trump is an idiot. Professor Farber's politics are up to him, but I'm coming to lecture to learn economics, not to listen to you talk about your personal political views, and honestly, who cares? To cap it all off, Professor Farber would mark off the more difficult slides and intentionally not explain them in lecture, because he ""didn't want to spend time in lecture on particularly dense lecture slides"", which is utterly backwards; obviously, you should be spending your time making sure students understand the more difficult parts of the material, not the easy parts! Then at the end of every lecture, he would lament that there wasn't enough time to cover all the material he'd planned to teach that day, so we'd have to review the last ? - ? (depending on the day) of the lecture slides on our own. Obviously there isn't enough time in lecture, since you spent half of it telling students that economics is really important, inflating your ego by talking about your credentials, telling students that you're colorblind, and announcing your political views to the room.Of course, I should probably be very happy that Professor Farber didn't teach all of the material. When it came time to do each problem set, I would read each question, and immediately google search the topic. I ended up learning most of the material, from Wikipedia, Investopedia, or ACDC Economics youtube videos. In fact, the more I relied on the professor to teach me a topic, the worse I ended up understanding it. Naturally, I stopped going to lecture, since it was a colossal waste of my time. But don't you worry, I had to waste my time on these problem sets, so the professor still got to waste several hours  ... [more]",,
"This course is very easy if you have already taken ECO 101.  If not, I would recommend using resources like McGraw to complete the assignments.",,
Take it!,,
I probably wouldn't take it unless it were for a requirement or major.,,
Ask a lot of questions in precept.,,
"If you take this, be prepared for a hell of a course. Farber can be a funny guy and catch you with some nice moments, but this boomer sometimes gets caught in his own world. The PSets are hell toward the end of the year, but working with friends makes it more manageable. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. We didn't use it at all, and Farber's powerpoints are much more tailored to learning the course than the wordy textbook. None of my friends and I bought it and the course went fine. All that aside, I did enjoy moments in the course and Farber as a person. Also, you'll love Stephanie as a preceptor because she is an absolute ANGEL.",,
I would suggest to study independently throughout the course and to go to office hours if you have a question on the problem set.,,
"Don't take with Farber unless you need to. Go to McGraw to deal with the horrible pests that make no sense. Lectures aren't super helpful, Farber tends to go off on boring lectures that make you feel like you are wasting time.",,
Learn stuff independently.,,
Make sure that you take notes on all the lectures and watch videos on econ of you need help,,
Do not take this course unless you have to. Go to McGraw! George is a great preceptor!,,
Not a difficult course and the concepts can be interesting if you are actually interested in economics. If you're taking it with Farber the lectures aren't really necessary; reading the lecture slides is enough.,,
I would say take this course if you absolutely have to. The professor is extremely confusing and the slides are irrelevant. The problem sets are your only chance at learning the material.,,
"Show up to lecture-- it's not that bad, and you learn a lot just by being there.",,
read the textbook,,
"Take it. It is a lot of reading, but you will learn vital material for later in life.",,
"attend precept, much more helpful than the lectures",,
Take this class if Professor Farber is teaching it!!! He makes the material seem easy but is also very willing to answer any questions students might have.,,
yes,,
I am neutral to this course because it can be very difficult and requires and can take up an abundance of time if you are not careful with your study habits.,,
Do not take this class if Henry Farber is teaching it.,,
Farber lectures are confusing but if you go over the slide and do the psets you can do okay,,
Read the textbook!,,
"if willing to put in the work, completely doable",,
"If this class is being taught by Farber, only take this class if it's a prerequisite. You will not get any econ knowledge from it.",,
This class was difficult at times but manageable. The lectures were helpful in understanding the key concepts and reasoning that would be seen in problem sets. The precept was very helpful in clarifying lecture material.,,
"The problem sets take the basics concepts learned in lecture and precept to the next level. Thorough understanding of the problem sets will lead to success in this course. To that end, the problem sets can be challenging. I found McGraw moderately helpful and study groups essential.",,
Psets and exams are fine as long as you prepare in advance and go to McGraw. DO NOT TAKE WITH FARBER. He will only confuse and bore you.,,
Don't buy the textbook.,,
This is a solid course - just be prepared to put work into understanding slides in your own time.,,
"I took this course as a prerequisite for WWS, and it's not as bad as people think. The professor speaks in a clear manner, but he reads off his powerpoint slides, so lectures aren't really necessary. It's not exactly boring but also not super exciting. I'd recommend this course if you want to have a basic knowledge of ECO 100, and as someone who took both ECO 101 and ECO 100, this course focuses more on economics material whereas ECO 101 also integrated current events. Precepts were very informative. The course is easy if you're P/D/Fing and mildly challenging if you're aiming for an A.",,
Read the textbook before coming to lectures.,,
Be sure to go to office hours.,,
"Dont take this course with farber. If you can get george as your preceptor, do that--hes the absolute best. Lectures are fast paced and lots of the content from the slides is not actually covered in lecture. Do the problem sets at mggraw--it will save you a lot of time.",,
make sure you go to McGraw-- they are so helpful with psets.,,
I didn't find the course that fascinating but it isn't too bad. Just be sure to ask questions and go to office hours if there's anything you don't understand.,,
"It is a good course in telling whether you should major in Econ, if you are considering it .",,
Work hard and good things will come,,
Go to McGraw to go over psets with the rest of the class. Read the textbook as it really makes up for what you don't always learn in lectures. Don't skip precepts as they are critical for understanding what may be misunderstood in lecture. Don't fall behind either as concepts build off of what you've already learned. It's also very useful to have at least some basic calculus to take this course as Professor Farber kind of expects a little bit of understanding on derivatives.,,
This is a very interesting class for majors and nonmajors and a good class for the social analysis requirement,,
Watch videos on Youtube. Reading the lecture slides on your own before going to lecture,,
Lectures are terribly hard to understand lol,,
I would advise other students to do the reading. It helped so much.,,
WOrk through the previous problem sets to prepare for the midterm and final,,
"If you have econ experience, then this might be a good class for you. Other than that, this class is a very difficult introduction into economics, and it is graded very harshly and inconsistently. If you need a distribution requirement, I'd take another class if possible.",,
Do the readings before each lecture. They are quick and make a big difference in the lecture understanding. It also allows you to do problem sets early.,,
I would say it is a hard course but it is one I recommend.,,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH FARBER IF YOU CAN HELP IT. ALSO DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN ECONOMICS. Not only will this course kill any desire for you to learn economics, it will cause your GPA to tank. By far, the worst class I have ever taken at Princeton, as my peers were as clueless as I was when filling out problem sets and studying for the final. It got to a point where I cried in a dining hall when someone asked me how this class was going. The only reason I didn't drop or PDF this class was because I thought I needed it for Woody Woo, a major I am now not considering (at which point the deadline had already passed to drop). I think the only good thing about this course is that it taught me to be resilient in the face of constant, gruelling failure, and let me know that I absolutely am not going to be doing any economic study in the future. TO REITERATE. IF FARBER IS TEACHING, DO NOT TAKE THIS L.",,
I would consider going to as many office hours as possible.,,
Pay attention in precept because the lectures are very hard to keep up with because the professor just reads the slides and moves on.,,
Take this course to get a great background about economics.,,
"It's a self-taught class. The lecture slides don't align with the PSETS, which don't' align with the midterm and final. McGraw tutors teach better than the professor and there are sites online that can explain the material 100x better than he could. Because of the materials available in other ways, the class becomes do-able but don't expect the professor or the slides to make the concept clearer",,
"If you have to take it, take it. If you think you might want to be an Econ major, take it. If you have to take it, there is no need to go out of your way to take this class.",,
"Please know that the lectures will suck and be a waste of time. Nothing you can do. Although, George was an AMAZING preceptor. If he is still teaching then make sure to snag him ASAP.",,
I would tell them to make sure to attend lectures and may attention otherwise things get confusing,,
