Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Good course. Hard but informational. Not ideal as a distribution requirement.,,
a very good intro class on IR. the materials are interesting and not too overwhelming. the first paper was graded kind of harshly but maybe that's cause it's my first pol class. Majo is an amazing preceptor!,,
"If you can, you should take this class if you like politics. I thought it was really interesting, and enjoyed learning from it. Professor Perlman's lectures are great and she really explains everything and answers questions. The readings lean on the heavier side, but they're really not too bad. If you're on top of the readings and lecture, you'd do well here.",,
"This course works well as an introduction to international systems and issues. As a first-semester freshman, I felt that my lack of experience did not hinder me in this class. Professor Perlman is a great lecturer and encourages participation even in a large lecture. The preceptors are well-prepared and mine was a fabulous teacher. Take this class if you are interested in SPIA and don't know where to start.",,
"Strongly recommend even if you are not an international relations major. It's a great class to take to get a broad understand of everything, economics, politics, money policy, game theory, trade, current affairs. Perlman is a great lecturer and preceptors were also really great! Readings are super interesting and you don't need to do all of them because there's a lot. Just get the main idea and you are good. There are not a lot of essays, just a midterm and final and two reflection papers in between. Very doable class, even in a four course semester.",,
"I very much enjoyed this class as a first-sem freshman for a SPIA pre-req. It is not too much work in terms of assignments to turn in, just a few papers, and the reading is definitely manageable. The professor and preceptors are great, and especially if you can take it in a non-virtual format, I think the discussion will be great.",,
"Take it, take it, take it! If you are debating introductory courses in politics (ie, comp vs IR etc), take this course with Prof Perlman - you will not regret it! It is an engaging course that is perfectly aimed at a younger audience. Also, do not miss a chance to get Majo (Maria Jose) as your preceptor - she's brilliant!",,
Invest time for the readings.,,
Take this class! even if it is not for a major requirement. This class is super interesting and Professor Perlman is a great lecture.,,
Do the readings; precept becomes pointless without at least a basic knowledge of what the author tried to say.,,
"If you're interested in international relations, I cannot recommend this course highly enough. This is the best course I've taken at Princeton so far. Professor Perlman and the preceptors are excellent at presenting the material clearly and provide an amazing learning environment. This course doesn't just teach you international relations; it also helps you build critical thinking skills to analyze world events.",,
moderately interesting. will be able to get a good grade if you just do the readings. exams are solely based on readings.,,
Don't fall behind with readings and do go to your preceptor's office hours if you have questions.,,
Take it for the requirement,,
"take this if you have never taken another ir class before, but if you have taken another ir or ir related class then you shouldn't take this cause you'll already know most of the material and the upkeep for this class is kinda a lot, provides a good overview of a lotta different topics, but may be better to take classes focusing on specific parts (like Vreeland's IO class!) to learn more about one part and in any more in depth ir class you'll learn most of what this class teaches anyway so if you're pol prolly shouldn't take this class but if you aren't pol or are a freshman then this class may be good",,
"This is a great introduction to international relations. Prof. Perlman is a fantastic lecturer, and my preceptor Sam was extremely clear at explaining concepts. I recommend going to office with any questions you have. Overall, the workload was extremely fair, and if you consistently attended lectures and understood the key takeaways from readings (about 100 pages a week, very fair considering the amount of literature in this field), it was not a hard course. Prof. Perlman had live lectures with participation encouraged, which also made it feel like a real class in the zoom age.",,
"Good intro course for freshmen, not sure if I would recommend to older students.",,
"If you want to gain a good understanding of international relations or need to fulfill a requirement this is a solid choice. Prof. Perlman and the preceptors are very knowledgeable and great instructors. The content can get pretty dry at times though, so keep that in mind. Overall a pretty good class even if it wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I first enrolled.",,
One of the best Princeton courses I've taken! DO TAKE!,,
"The preceptor can make or break this class. I'm still confused and upset about the grading because my grade didn't change from when I did all the readings and had perfect attendance and notes, to when I fell off track and stopped paying attention in classes and doing the readings. It didn't matter how much effort I put in... my effort did not improve my grade. Lectures are kinda decent. They're easy to follow, but not particularly informative, and don't link to the readings much. This class wasn't horrible, but keep up with the readings or else you'll have a horrible time of finals like I did. Seriously. The finals for this exam were HORRIBLE. You're expected to remember all the readings and write 3 essays in 2 hours, PLUS cite all sources... Professor Perlman is sweet and helpful, though, and I respect that she's trying her best. Try to take this class with Majo, she's the best",,
"Try to take notes, whether during or after lecture, even if it's difficult to keep up. Also remember that much of the assessments are about the readings specifically, so don't base your understanding of the course solely on lecture.",,
"Please take precept with Sam! I'd never taken a politics course (well, because I'm a freshman) and he was super engaging and answered our questions so so well. I didn't talk too much during the precept and I was honestly quite grateful that I wasn't put on the spot. That's just a personal problem but he did such a great job clarifying readings and I genuinely became interested in international relations due to precept. The lectures were also phenomenal and just as engaging as the precept. The readings were very relevant to the lectures which I thought was great because that wasn't really the case for all of my classes. Seriously HIGHLY recommend this course if you have even the slightest interest in international relations.",,
"Great course, I recommend to any SPIA majors for the departmental, but also for anyone else interested in IR! Prof. Perlman is very passionate about the topic, and lectures are super engaging.",,
"Do the readings, take notes, be prepared to write essays",,
Great introductory course for judging your interest in International Relations.,,
"Quite dry, but decent for an intro course",,
POL240 is an excellent choice to satisfy the politics requirement for SPIA - I strongly recommend it!,,
"Absolutely take this course! Professor Perlman is incredible and definitely try to get Esther as your preceptor. Lectures are fun and interactive (even when they were online during fall 2020)! Most of your time for this course will be spent doing the readings. Most are really interesting. Some of them, although insightful, are just very long. Over time you will get better at skimming the reading for the most poignant information. Which preceptor you have is super important! Try to get Esther if you can! The grading on this course is really fair and if you put in the work it is an easy A- course.",,
"Grading for the midterm was a bit unfair but otherwise an interesting class with solid readings. Very helpful in providing you a framework through which to view international relations. Professor Perlman is an engaging lecturer who is good at explaining things in a clear, concise manner.",,
"This was an interesting survey of a lot of IR themes and ideas.  If you take the course, try and get into Sam's precept, by far one of the best preceptors I've had.",,
"Great introductory class about how countries interact, and the obstacles they must overcome while doing so. With the readings, focus on the big ideas rather than every minute point, but DO the readings and go to lecture and precept. This course will change the way you think about history, economics, and the world in general.",,
take it as an introduction to IR. the name says it best. It is probably not going to be one of those exciting and refreshing courses but it has helped me better understand why states interact with each other in the way they do,,
"Take this course when the others are not assigning many readings, covering them takes a lot of time but they are essential.",,
Make sure to take good notes on the lecture and readings. You have to study a lot for the final specifically due to the oral portion.,,
Do all the readings and participate in precept.,,
"Interesting course and a good SA option. Professor Perlman is an incredibly engaging lecturer, the readings are interesting and not usually too long, and it will change the way you look at both the world and the United States. It's harder than you think it will be, though, so definitely make a notes document of key points from readings and lectures as you go, and go to office hours to ask clarifying questions. The amount of material will sneak up on you if you're not careful.",,
go to lecture and take notes. Also the readings important and are tested on so do them.,,
"Take this class! Professor Perlman is an amazing lecturer and makes the concepts very easy to understand. It might be more theory based than you may expect, but still incredibly helpful in developing your perspective on the world. Also, Esther is the best preceptor!",,
Start your readings early and write response papers on topics that are of particular interest to you,,
"My first POL course and I loved it! Skim readings to get the main points so you can participate in precept, but dive deep for when you write papers. Participate and have fun, great engaging class with lots of relevant materials. Sam's precept is super, ask questions! I've heard that this is supposed to be one of the most difficult POL courses, but just do the readings and attend lecture and it shouldn't be.",,
I would suggest to start the readings early in the week. Will not be able to read everything the night before.,,
"Keep up with the readings, go to lecture.",,
The readings were fairly interesting but I found that they could be a bit dense sometimes and take longer than you might think.,,
Make sure you both do the readings and attend lecture as they will both cover different and important aspects of the course material.,,
"This course is not too difficult while remaining interesting throughout. Professor Perlman is very smart and a good instructor, and everyone is very responsive. If you take the course, make sure to stay on top of readings (I recommend doing them before class each week), it will make class make more sense. Do the writing response on a week that you aren't too busy with other stuff. Check in with your preceptor about your writing or comprehension if you are worried.",,
"If you've ever read the international news section in a newspaper and felt like you didn't understand what was going or why some things happen, then you should take this course. The course covers nearly every aspect of international politics and gives you real world knowledge about the complex world of international studies. If you have any interest in international politics, then this is the right choice for you.",,
"This course sounds interesting, yet is drier than you would expect. As someone who enjoyed POL230 tremendously, I found the readings much more dull, the lectures much less stimulating, and the precepts much less useful. Moreover, the expectations for the paper are seriously unclear and only released after the fact. That being said, Prof. Perlman is an amazing lecturer, and the preceptors are quite good too.",,
Perlman is great. Pretty solid departmental. Beware that precepts are pretty inconsistent depending on who is teaching the section.,,
"It was helpful for me to do the readings and keep organized notes that include a quick summary of each paper and definitions of terms (from both readings and lecture). This year the final consisted of a verbal exam where we defined terms, and a timed written exam. This class is a lot of work.",,
I would recommend going to all precepts and reading the materials thoroughly.,,
"Professor Perlman, and especially Esther as a preceptor, make this course. The readings are important and may be numerous, but they are still very interesting. Definitely take this course if you're looking for a departmental course and even if just for general interest!",,
"Do the readings. Participate in precept. Write your papers CLEARLY. This is not an easy A at all, but you'll learn a lot about the fundamentals of international relations. Definitely a necessary course for SPIA majors.",,
take the class!,,
