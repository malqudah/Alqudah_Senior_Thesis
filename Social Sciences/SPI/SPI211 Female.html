It can seem a little overwhelming if you've never coded before, but it is not too bad since you have your preceptors and McGraw to help you get started. The lectures were not helpful, the textbook and precepts are. If you need this to get your QR or for a departmental, you won't be too overwhelmed. Don't stress.</div>

Instead they made the homework assignments longer, more challenging  and the exams more difficult. I therefore found their concern insincere and offensive. </div>

Course leaves a lot to be desired as the only real statistics content (regressions, significance testing, some probability) was covered extremely quickly in the last week while the rest is just tedious "programming" in R. Recommend taking ORF 245 or SML 201 if you want to learn stuff, take this if you want a free A. Textbooks fantastic tho.</div>

It's still probably the best and easiest way to get the Woodrow Wilson stats prereq, but don't expect much from the lectures and be prepared to learn a lot on your own.</div>

I would recommend this course to people needing a stats prereq; I feel like I actually learned a lot about r and a little about statistics. I took the class during spring 2020 so it was mandatory PDF, which I was glad about. If you can, go to McGraw and ask for lots of help with the psets!</div>

Lectures are largely optional, though the textbook is useful. Go to office hours for specific help and employ McGraw and R programming tutor! The class had a bad reputation but really it's not that bad; the professor is very nice and accommodating and has modified the course so that the assignments aren't too bad </div>

Now I'm taking COS 126 next semester. It is challenging, though, so make sure you do your work and go to office hours for psets.  </div>

The piece that took a lot of time, but overall it's a fine course. The lectures weren't the most informative, you're really gonna have to do self teaching. I don't believe that I learned enough for my JP but I heard the DSS lab was a great resource.</div>

But gives you an amazing set of tools for analyzing data sets. If you have to take a stats class, this one is great. But to really learn, you've gotta put a substantial amount of time into the problem sets</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I think this class was really interesting and cool. If only there was better teaching and instruction (and available help), I would  have found this class to be much more enjoyable.</div>

However, I wouldn't recommend this class for those who aren't required to take it and who aren't familiar with coding.</div>

I really did not get much from lecture because of the way it was set up.The professor grazed the surface of alot of things but never went in-depth. I did most of my learning on my own and in precept. I would still recommend this over some of the other stats classes, based on my own experience and the experience of my peers in the other stats classes.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Take it with Titiunik if it's required. I think with her the course is relatively fairer and easier to understand. And possibly the work is easier? Titiunik is a funny professor, she's super chill. I think R is an important skill that will be useful in life. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Keep up with the readings and try the examples on your own because that's how you learn to code. Don't get frustrated or intimidated at the beginning of the course because it's like that for everyone and you will be fine as long as you ask questions and get extra help if you need it. If you don't do the readings you won't have a clue how to complete the psets. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I learned so much in this class and would highly recommend as a way to fulfill your QR/any lower-level statistics requirement. Professor Titiunik is incredibly approachable; if you take the class with her, try to either get her or Xiaoxiao as a preceptor because they'll be REALLY helpful with the problem sets. Lectures were usually pretty chaotic and not always relevant to the problem sets or exams. Problem sets get a lot harder after the midterm, but if you ask for help and work with a friend you'll be fine. This class requires engagement and keeping up with the material, but it doesn't actually take you that much time to get your work done and the coding aspect is really rewarding. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Do the readings, go to precept, and you will do well. This is a great introduction to coding and R. As someone with no previous coding experience, I found the class to be very fair. There are many resources available if you are struggling. Reach out to TAs, go to office hours, go to McGraw. Don't fall behind!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Very interesting class especially if you are a stem major with a humanities inclination. The concepts aren't terribly challenging and neither is R. I wish it wasnt PDF only this semester.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Really annoying that the course became mandatory PDF this semester, but overall not too challenging and you definitely will learn some useful coding skills</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">It's definitely tough. It's not as hard as some people say, but it isn't easy. I would recommend waiting for the spring semester to take it with Prof. Titiunik because from what I've heard from friends, she seems much nicer and a little bit easier than the fall semester professor. It's also fewer kids in lecture than fall semester which makes it easier to ask questions. It's fine to take if you need a pol analytical class, but just be prepared to really work. Go to office hours and McGraw and you should be fine. Just be prepared to cry a couple times. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is the perfect statistics course for all social science/humanities students. Professor Titiunik keeps the class moving and makes the lectures really engaging. I took the class as a first-year, and while the problem sets and outside reading are a decent amount of work, I found that it was manageable so don't be afraid to take this course early on.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">If you are a COS student do yourself a favor and do not take this course! I'm serious. The easy A is NOT worth it. You will be bored out of your mind and frustrated with the pace and quality of instruction. I you want to learn R find a data set and tinker around with it or read through the textbook for the class.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Take it with Mark.</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This course was awesome! I can't tell if it was because of the material or the professor, but it's probably both! You learn some essential concepts in statistics and how to program in R. The workload is never extreme and the exams are very fair. Only consider not taking this course if you struggle with basic computer programming or any kind of math-oriented learning.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Keep up</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">If you already know how to code (Java, Python, etc), this course will be extremely easy. I saw people who couldn't code before catch on pretty quickly though. The statistics isn't particularly hard until the end where it gets a bit harder (speaking from the perspective of someone who has never taken a stats course before). The book mirrors the lectures exactly. If you actually want to understand the concepts, reading the book is paramount because the lectures are very disorganized. I found that McGraw was not as helpful for this course because the tutors weren't familiar with how the new professor was doing things. Hopefully, this will be rectified next semester.</div>

However, Prof. Titiunik is incredible at breaking concepts down so that they are easily accessible to students and helped us through the process of having a better hold of quantitative reasoning and coding. </div>

If you have, avoid this class unless you need it for a requirement. If you're looking to learn statistics, I recommend "Improving your statistical inferences" on Coursera. It also uses R.</div>

Class went PDFO, so although it was trending a bit easier than in years past, we'll never know how the grades turned out. Consider taking this for a decent primer in R and some basic statistics.</div>

Any prior background in coding, no matter how small, will definitely help at the beginning. However, you can pick it up really quickly if you read the textbook well. It is super helpful, I highly recommend relying on it</div>

It really made me think about the material in an academic way. I definitely think this was one of my favorite classes this semester thanks to Prof T.</div>

As someone with no statistics background, I found most of the semester very easy, with the except of the more conceptual content we covered towards the end, which I felt was a significant leap up in difficulty.I would strongly recommend doing the reading for this course. I know people who didn't and did fine, but if you don't have any background in the material, it helps to go over it once in the reading and once in lecture. Find a partner for the psets since some of the questions can get really vague.Overall, I'd recommend this course even if you don't need it. Understanding statistical analysis is something I find really valuable in general.</div>

This course is super useful for social science majors who are interested in the more science and tech aspects of social science. Moderate amount of work. Precepts are super helpful, so go to them! Office hours too!</div>

It's mainly just students who are taking it for a distribution requirement, but if you want to learn R, I definitely suggest taking the course with Professor Titiunik. There are weekly assignments instead of just a few, so you have room to do poorly sometimes because there are so many assignments. If you take this course, try to get into Professor Titiunik's precept because she was so helpful and let us ask many questions. </div>
