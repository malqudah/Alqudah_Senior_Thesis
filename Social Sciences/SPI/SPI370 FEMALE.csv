Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Definitely take! I enjoyed it,,
TAKE THIS COURSE! So well taught (esp virtually) and teaches you a lot about the world.,,
This is a very interesting course and I felt like I learned a lot. The course moves quickly and many of the readings are very dense.,,
"Amazing class! Assignments are graded reasonably and the content is very relevant and engaging. If you can, get Professor Easton as your preceptor. She is incredible!",,
Good SPIA departmental. Precepts with Professor Easton were great,,
Tough course,,
Take this class as a departmental. Do the readings and go to lecture to do well. Precepts are pretty fun and the material is interesting.,,
"I did really bad in previous ethics class and was really worried about this class, but this class is a nice balance of ethics and policy. The workload is really heavy for me, but I learned a lot",,
"for this departmental, take it. for general interest, its too much work (lots of reading and exams)",,
"Fantastic departmental for SPIA, definitely should be taken and preferably earlier than later.",,
"Great class, I would totally recommend it! It's not necessarily easy but it is a very interesting class.",,
Hard class...more work than it's worth,,
"I would advise other students to ask as many questions as they need. Philosophy is its own language, and it's okay to need clarity on phrases that seem like they shoul  be simple at first glance.",,
I enjoyed this class a lot,,
"Do not take this unless you have to. I really did not enjoy the subject matter. However, it was not exceedingly hard. I think if you understand multiple angles of each philosopher's arguments, you will do well. I did really like my preceptor though, but she lives in London so unlikely you will get her.",,
"This was a fantastic class. There is a lot of reading, but it was engaging if you are interested in the course material. Only take this course if you have to or if you are interested in the topic, but if you are it is a great course. Get Sonny as your preceptor.",,
"Even if ethics and philosophy isn't your strong-suit, Professor Bolinger and Professor Macedo give great support in getting to learn the concepts. There is overall great support from the preceptors too as I heard nothing bad from anyone about them.",,
"Ok requirement. Ethics were mostly theoretical, little discussion of interesting ethical questions such as ethics of self driving cars or actually drafting policy to make the future more ethical. Precepts were far more engaging.",,
"Taking this class with 4 friends, all of us have been graded incredibly harshly imo compared to overall gpa/ performance in other classes. B-range grades are pretty doable but A-range is very difficult. Even participation is super hard to get an A-range grade in. Take PDF bc its interesting or maybe try to find an easier one if you care about your gpa",,
I highly recommend taking this class for the SPIA requirement.,,
"I was not excited for this course (WWS departmental) but Professor Macedo and Professor Bolinger are GREAT! They handled remote teaching like a champ, and I honestly appreciate their consideration and care for students so much. I would strongly recommend this class, as it has helped me articulate my opinions on complex ethical issues much more clearly (As well as exposing me to the complex ethical challenges that underly policy decisions)",,
"If you are not in the department, this is interesting subject matter but a lot of work and may be a bit over your head.",,
"Great overview of major ethical frameworks that are quite relevant to public policy. Lectures very engaging and readings manageable, especially as a remote course.",,
"This is a really interesting and well taught class. The professors are great, and have lots of office hours which is nice. They also present confusing material in a clear way. However, I think the grading standards are slightly harsh and arbitrary (This is truly the first time I have said this about a Princeton class). Therefore, if you are looking for an A, regardless of how much work you put in, it sometimes is unattainable. However, that said, I would still strongly recommend this to other students as I think the material is really important!",,
Stay on top of readings and go to office hours.,,
Take it only if you need to or if you can pdf. class puts a cap on As.,,
This course discusses several topics in politics/public policy as they relate to ethics. I recommend it!,,
Take only if you are deeply interested in the subject!,,
"This is honestly not a great class. Lectures were dry, papers were poorly explained and graded harshly, and the viewpoints represented were limited, and at times xenophobic and even racist. Some of the readings and professor's viewpoints were honestly shitty takes, which were then just repeated by the other students until the whole class environment felt uncomfortable.",,
"I cannot stress this enough: Professor Bolinger is absolutely amazing!! I thought I hated philosophy and ethics. I dreaded this requirement like no other. I thought this class would be the bane of my semester. Instead, it was my favorite class, and I learned more than I thought possible. Professor Bolinger made an online semester enjoyable, brought enthusiasm and depth to precepts, and really facilitated discussion well. We actually ""worked through"" issues rather than simply applying lenses, and built a comprehensive understanding of how ethics might practically fit into policymaking. TAKE THIS WITH BOLINGER!!",,
"Take this course, whether or not you're in SPIA! A super thought-provoking course that really challenges whatever worldview you hold coming into the class. Make sure to get one of the professors as your preceptor!",,
Awesome class for EM and also super topical and gives great insight on political philosophy!,,
"Take it! Great class to fulfill the SPIA ethics requirement. Solid, you'll learn a lot, and it's so organized you always know what's coming.",,
Don't take unless you have to.,,
"This class is a good choice for the ethics requirement for SPIA, but I don't know if I would recommend taking it just for fun. It was pretty interesting, a bit disorganized, but a good class overall.",,
Good course for gaining a background in moral theories applied to public policy issues. Good SPIA departmental. Lectures/information is not presented in most clear manner. Exams/papers were easy.,,
Pay attention,,
I would recommend utilizing resources such as the preceptor and writing center to ensure that your understanding of the material is adequate and your communication of the material in papers is succinct.,,
"Decent class to fulfill the SPIA ethics requirement. Sometimes, the lecturers ramble and get very abstract in their explanations, but I think the course definitely exposes you to new topics and centering our own personal moral convictions",,
"A fair bit of reading but interesting, a good distribution rec choice",,
Take the course,,
"This class was super interesting and I would HIGHLY recommend. I loved the topics we talked about (just war, torturing terrorists, justice in punishment/incarceration, immigration, etc.) as a would-be criminology major + someone interested in ethics and national security. NOT an easy A, depending on your preceptor. I took it PDF and thus found it great, once I didn't need to worry about grades.",,
"Not a bad SPIA core class, but I wouldn't take it otherwise. The content of the course is interesting and important, but the course was run poorly. Maybe it was just the virtual semester that caused issues, but the grading seems arbitrary (and possible grade deflation?) and they changed the syllabus at the end of the semester. Also, they cold-called in lecture which I did not appreciate. That being said, the content of the course is really, really interesting (the ethics of torture, immigration policy, prison reform etc.). If you are taking it, get Ben for precept!",,
"I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this class. I took it for the SPIA material, and was apprehensive because I don't particularly enjoy abstract philosophical discussions. Professors Bolinger and Macedo did a great job grounding our conversations in policy decisions. I found myself consistently discussing the topics and points we brought up to friends and still am thinking about it.",,
This was a super interesting course and Professors Macedo and Bollinger are amazing. Start the readings and papers early.,,
