Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Interesting material but a lot of history (2/3 of the course). Contemporary issues are explored after midterms. Assignments are straightforward and expectations are clear. Lots of reading.,,
Take this class if you're interested. There's a lot of readings but Professor Chen is incredibly understanding and realistic about the expectations of the course in general. Beyond that she has a breadth of knowledge beyond compare.,,
"I liked this course generally. The readings were very interesting and really get us to understand the background of Chinese politics/foreign relations. Lectures had some issues. While lectures got down the basic concepts, I feel sometimes Professor Chen would talk about abstract CCP figures and their backgrounds which weren't relevant to the topic. This got particularly annoying when Professor Chen asked us to stay over time because she couldn't fit what she wanted to say in 50 minutes. Esther is a great preceptor!",,
Take the course!,,
