I had zero coding experience, so it was a little overwhelming in the beginning, but the instructors are aware that many students don't know R. The weekly psets were not fun, but mcgraw and office hours (especially Ian's) were super helpful (lecture covered the foundations but wasn't very in-depth), and working through the psets gives you good practice. Definitely a lot of coding required, but the statistics part is not as in-depth. </div>

Can't speak about how this class is during a regular year, but it was horrible having it remote. The lectures are really boring and everything the professor mentioned is in the book (like the examples presented) and does not really help much for the problem sets. Also, the problem sets after the midterm began to get unreasonable. They either had problems within the data itself or it was impossible to do them because what was asked couldn't be found in the book or lecture. Most preceptors were honestly not really helpful, but Perry really carried the class. That man deserves an award because anything I actually was able to learn was from him. Another great preceptor was Sojun, super willing to help at all times. In conclusion, this is the worst class I have taken at Princeton. I couldn't be happier to finally be done with it. Oh, let's not forget the 6 hour midterm we had that took every single person I know the entire time to finish. o</div>

If you are SPIA, take another course for the statistics prereq. As someone who did not have coding experience, this class was a nightmare. All the lectures were theoretical. The precepts just throw you in breakout rooms where everyone is just guessing how to code the exercise. The midterm and the final are all coding based so even if you understand the concept, you will do poorly on the exam  if you can't code. Although the curve is nice. If you have to take the class, get Perry as your preceptor. He will be more useful than the professor. </div>

I took it as a general distribution and was horrified at the difficulty they tacked onto it in this year's format despite it being required for several majors. If you know how to code in R you should be fine, but otherwise, you will be teaching yourself all semester, and should expect to go to mcgraw and office hours for several hours a week.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Expect to do a lot of independent studying if you're a beginner coder. The preceptors are incredibly kind and helpful but it can get frustrating since lecture does not cover coding mechanics at all, just theories. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This course is very strangely organized. It's described as a class that requires no previous programming experience, yet you cover almost none of the programming in lecture that you'll need to complete the problem sets. Instead, Professor Judd spends a ton of time going over very simple concepts that should take less than a minute to explain. It is not an exaggeration when I say we spent 30 minutes of a 50-minute lecture going over how to set the working directory in RStudio. While I did have programming experience and the first 80% of the semester was pretty easy, I can't say I'd recommend this course to  anyone who doesn't already have a working knowledge of coding (COS 126 would be enough). I also wish this class would focus more on the applied skills we need to actually do research (hypothesis testing) rather than spending weeks on simple calculations and looking at the mean/median of distributions. This course would also benefit from teaching ggplot2, which is the modern standard for visualization in R, instead of base graphics, which is used much less frequently. Overall, I'd say you should take SML 201 if your goal is to learn how to do data science rather than briefly touch on a bunch of statistical concepts and be thrown into the deep end for the coding assignments.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would strongly advise against taking this class unless you really have to. The lectures did not cover what was required in the weekly psets so be prepared to devote a lot of time to figuring it out or attend office hours/McGraw. There is also a lot more coding required for this class than they let on, and next to none of it is taught so unless you have already coded before it is going to be a steep learning curve. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I didn't attend lectures because they were never applicable to the actual work we were doing. As long as you are able to teach yourself the stuff from the book, you will learn enough.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a prereq so if you're SPIA you'll have to take it. Don't take with Prof. Judd, he knows what he's doing in terms of coding but he is a very new prof with virtually no teaching experience and cannot explain anything.  Try to get Perry Carter for precept, he's by far the most helpful preceptor and actually is much more involved with the students/answering questions than the main prof. This course in spring 2021 was absolutely miserable. Despite devoting a massive amount of time to the material and problem sets, I feel that I have learned virtually nothing about coding in R or applying the concepts we have learned to the data. This class is a total time suck and will leave you feeling discouraged about the POL/SPIA department. I seriously considered changing my major from SPIA to something else after this class because I was afraid of having to take another class like this one. </div>

I came in with statistics and coding language and it was still ridiculously difficult. Easy content was rendered incomprehensible by the poor teaching.  If you have to take it, make sure you're in Perry's precept, he's the only reason this course was bearable.</div>

Go to office hours and ask as many questions as you can because thats the only help you're gonna get. Just give it your best shot.

Psets are difficult and midterm was insanely hard for pretty much everyone. If you want an A you are going to have put in many many hours per week. However Perry is the saving grace of this course! Being in his precept is an absolute must.</div>

I think the online content probably impacted things, but lectures were so dry and either went way too in-depth into intuitive concepts or breezed through statistical concepts in a confusing way. You're probably taking this as a requirement, in which case it's really not too bad - I feel like most assignments were reasonable and although the midterm was a mess they cleaned up their act for the final. There are a lot of office hours so get help if you need it. Perry is a great preceptor so get him if possible. I genuinely was interested in the content which is why it is a shame the class was so unengaging and lectures were meh. I did learn a decent amount of R and a smattering of stats, but I don't really think the class accomplished what it is intending to. </div>

He carried this course in so many ways, answering the Ed Board questions, hosting optional Tidyverse tutorial sessions, hosting finals review sessions, holding a tight precept... I don't know how this course would function without him. The course itself teaches basic R-programming for stats, though I wish it really changed up its statistical measures (e.g., a lot of calculating means and medians). But it's about what you expect from an intro stats course, though I wish it were more theoretical.</div>

Except, the R part is not taught super well. People without coding experience will likely struggle a little, and those with will still probably be pretty irritated by problem sets and exams that are super vaguely written. Doable, but not very fun.</div>

The instruction on the coding is very minimal and most of the lectures focus on the statistical analysis component of the course. Try your hardest not to get behind, because the class moves very quickly and there really isn't a space to ask questions when you do get behind. </div>
