Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Good intro course for data analysis. It can seem a little overwhelming if you've never coded before, but it is not too bad since you have your preceptors and McGraw to help you get started. The lectures were not helpful, the textbook and precepts are. If you need this to get your QR or for a departmental, you won't be too overwhelmed. Don't stress.",,
"This is not a bad stats course for WWS majors. You will need to go to Mcgraw for Psets, but if you do the work, you won't do poorly.",,
"This staff said that they cared about students' wellbeing and did not want to add to their stress during COVD-19, but that was not reflected in their actions in the slightest. Instead they made the homework assignments longer, more challenging  and the exams more difficult. I therefore found their concern insincere and offensive.",,
"I copped out hard taking this (had AP stats and COS 126 yet HPA still insisted i take one of the underwhelming intro stats courses) and also this was the profs first time teaching this and also corona so take the following with a grain of salt. Course leaves a lot to be desired as the only real statistics content (regressions, significance testing, some probability) was covered extremely quickly in the last week while the rest is just tedious ""programming"" in R. Recommend taking ORF 245 or SML 201 if you want to learn stuff, take this if you want a free A. Textbooks fantastic tho.",,
"A word to the wise, this course was changed dramatically in 2019, when a new professor came. It's still probably the best and easiest way to get the Woodrow Wilson stats prereq, but don't expect much from the lectures and be prepared to learn a lot on your own.",,
"Keep up with textbook readings. Go to class. I would recommend this course to people needing a stats prereq; I feel like I actually learned a lot about r and a little about statistics. I took the class during spring 2020 so it was mandatory PDF, which I was glad about. If you can, go to McGraw and ask for lots of help with the psets!",,
Amazing course under new leadership (Professor Titiunik). She is kind and thoughtful and very knowledgeable.,,
"Prepare to dedicate three to five hours each week completing assignments if you have no experience. Lectures are largely optional, though the textbook is useful. Go to office hours for specific help and employ McGraw and R programming tutor! The class had a bad reputation but really it's not that bad; the professor is very nice and accommodating and has modified the course so that the assignments aren't too bad",,
DO NOT take unless you have to. Maybe the weekly assignments would not be so hard if the class wasn't so poorly taught. Unless you want to teach yourself to code do not take.,,
"If you want some basic skills in R, this is a good course to take!",,
"I took this course for a psych prereq not knowing anything about coding and then ended up really liking it. Now I'm taking COS 126 next semester. It is challenging, though, so make sure you do your work and go to office hours for psets.",,
"Lecture is not necessary, but might be helpful, it depends on you and your previous experience. The piece that took a lot of time, but overall it's a fine course. The lectures weren't the most informative, you're really gonna have to do self teaching. I don't believe that I learned enough for my JP but I heard the DSS lab was a great resource.",,
I would recommend reading the textbook and using that to answer the problem sets. That helped me the most.,,
"Good course, easy if you're COS.",,
"More coding focused than statistics focused. But gives you an amazing set of tools for analyzing data sets. If you have to take a stats class, this one is great. But to really learn, you've gotta put a substantial amount of time into the problem sets",,
"I think this class was really interesting and cool. If only there was better teaching and instruction (and available help), I would  have found this class to be much more enjoyable.",,
"If this course is required for your major I actually wouldn't say that it's so bad, because it is completely do-able to learn the required material and complete the problem sets as long as you put in some work, and there's a ton of resources available if you need help. However, I wouldn't recommend this class for those who aren't required to take it and who aren't familiar with coding.",,
Take this course if it isn't online.,,
"I enjoyed the problem sets because they required some thinking, however, I still dislike the coding language of R. I really did not get much from lecture because of the way it was set up.The professor grazed the surface of alot of things but never went in-depth. I did most of my learning on my own and in precept. I would still recommend this over some of the other stats classes, based on my own experience and the experience of my peers in the other stats classes.",,
"Take it with Titiunik if it's required. I think with her the course is relatively fairer and easier to understand. And possibly the work is easier? Titiunik is a funny professor, she's super chill. I think R is an important skill that will be useful in life.",,
Keep up with the readings and try the examples on your own because that's how you learn to code. Don't get frustrated or intimidated at the beginning of the course because it's like that for everyone and you will be fine as long as you ask questions and get extra help if you need it. If you don't do the readings you won't have a clue how to complete the psets.,,
"I learned so much in this class and would highly recommend as a way to fulfill your QR/any lower-level statistics requirement. Professor Titiunik is incredibly approachable; if you take the class with her, try to either get her or Xiaoxiao as a preceptor because they'll be REALLY helpful with the problem sets. Lectures were usually pretty chaotic and not always relevant to the problem sets or exams. Problem sets get a lot harder after the midterm, but if you ask for help and work with a friend you'll be fine. This class requires engagement and keeping up with the material, but it doesn't actually take you that much time to get your work done and the coding aspect is really rewarding.",,
"Do the readings, go to precept, and you will do well. This is a great introduction to coding and R. As someone with no previous coding experience, I found the class to be very fair. There are many resources available if you are struggling. Reach out to TAs, go to office hours, go to McGraw. Don't fall behind!",,
Very interesting class especially if you are a stem major with a humanities inclination. The concepts aren't terribly challenging and neither is R. I wish it wasnt PDF only this semester.,,
"Really annoying that the course became mandatory PDF this semester, but overall not too challenging and you definitely will learn some useful coding skills",,
"It's definitely tough. It's not as hard as some people say, but it isn't easy. I would recommend waiting for the spring semester to take it with Prof. Titiunik because from what I've heard from friends, she seems much nicer and a little bit easier than the fall semester professor. It's also fewer kids in lecture than fall semester which makes it easier to ask questions. It's fine to take if you need a pol analytical class, but just be prepared to really work. Go to office hours and McGraw and you should be fine. Just be prepared to cry a couple times.",,
"This is the perfect statistics course for all social science/humanities students. Professor Titiunik keeps the class moving and makes the lectures really engaging. I took the class as a first-year, and while the problem sets and outside reading are a decent amount of work, I found that it was manageable so don't be afraid to take this course early on.",,
If you are a COS student do yourself a favor and do not take this course! I'm serious. The easy A is NOT worth it. You will be bored out of your mind and frustrated with the pace and quality of instruction. I you want to learn R find a data set and tinker around with it or read through the textbook for the class.,,
Take it with Mark.,,
"If you need a stats class, this would be the one to take. If you reach out for help you'll be fine.",,
Really great teachers.,,
MAke sure you come prepared to work very hard,,
Professor Titunik is so great! She is very understanding of every student's situations and made the course very accessible to students with no coding experience.,,
"This course was awesome! I can't tell if it was because of the material or the professor, but it's probably both! You learn some essential concepts in statistics and how to program in R. The workload is never extreme and the exams are very fair. Only consider not taking this course if you struggle with basic computer programming or any kind of math-oriented learning.",,
Keep up,,
"If it is with Prof. Titiunik, the exams are timed, not like the other one that gives a range of days to complete it. Helps you with learning the basics of programming.",,
"If you already know how to code (Java, Python, etc), this course will be extremely easy. I saw people who couldn't code before catch on pretty quickly though. The statistics isn't particularly hard until the end where it gets a bit harder (speaking from the perspective of someone who has never taken a stats course before). The book mirrors the lectures exactly. If you actually want to understand the concepts, reading the book is paramount because the lectures are very disorganized. I found that McGraw was not as helpful for this course because the tutors weren't familiar with how the new professor was doing things. Hopefully, this will be rectified next semester.",,
If you've coded before this class will be a breeze.,,
"Good stats class, interesting social issues to analyze",,
"McGraw. its not as bad as u think but u will still suffer a bit. just, go to McGraw, study I guess, figure out code that they don't teach u, and pray.",,
Only take if you need it for departmental or are good at coding.,,
Use resources such as McGraw and work with other students!,,
"Good class, very tedious work tough",,
"As someone without any prior coding experience, this course was very challenging. However, Prof. Titiunik is incredible at breaking concepts down so that they are easily accessible to students and helped us through the process of having a better hold of quantitative reasoning and coding.",,
"If you've never coded before, that's okay this class will teach you. If you have, avoid this class unless you need it for a requirement. If you're looking to learn statistics, I recommend ""Improving your statistical inferences"" on Coursera. It also uses R.",,
"Do the readings, go to lecture, and stay on top of your work and this class genuinely won't be that bad!",,
"Rocio tried her best this semester. Class went PDFO, so although it was trending a bit easier than in years past, we'll never know how the grades turned out. Consider taking this for a decent primer in R and some basic statistics.",,
"This course was not as much of a struggle as I thought it would be. Any prior background in coding, no matter how small, will definitely help at the beginning. However, you can pick it up really quickly if you read the textbook well. It is super helpful, I highly recommend relying on it",,
Definitely take this class for an Intro to Statistics/R requirement. It really made me think about the material in an academic way. I definitely think this was one of my favorite classes this semester thanks to Prof T.,,
"I took this course as a WWS prerequisite, but I genuinely found it pretty interesting with Professor Titiunik. As someone with no statistics background, I found most of the semester very easy, with the except of the more conceptual content we covered towards the end, which I felt was a significant leap up in difficulty.I would strongly recommend doing the reading for this course. I know people who didn't and did fine, but if you don't have any background in the material, it helps to go over it once in the reading and once in lecture. Find a partner for the psets since some of the questions can get really vague.Overall, I'd recommend this course even if you don't need it. Understanding statistical analysis is something I find really valuable in general.",,
"An okay coding class dealing with basic social stats concepts. Nothing too exciting, but you will walk out with essential background if you have none.",,
"This is a good introduction course to R, the lectures this semester were not great, but don't let that discourage you from taking this class (there was a pandemic!) This course is super useful for social science majors who are interested in the more science and tech aspects of social science. Moderate amount of work. Precepts are super helpful, so go to them! Office hours too!",,
It is a really interesting course once you get the hang of it and understand R. definitely engage with your preceptors and professors for help,,
I learned more coding than actually statistics.,,
"Take it if you have to, but I wouldn't recommend otherwise",,
The course is good definitely pay attention and read the textbook. The class is a lot of work but enjoyable.,,
Only take this if you absolutely need too for major.,,
"I think this is an interesting course if you want to learn coding. It's mainly just students who are taking it for a distribution requirement, but if you want to learn R, I definitely suggest taking the course with Professor Titiunik. There are weekly assignments instead of just a few, so you have room to do poorly sometimes because there are so many assignments. If you take this course, try to get into Professor Titiunik's precept because she was so helpful and let us ask many questions.",,
