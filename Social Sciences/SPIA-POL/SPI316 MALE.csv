Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Take this course!! (But clarify all due dates the Flaherty himself)Professor Flaherty is a fantastic professor that is super engaging and really cares about his students. The fact that so many people took this class despite it being a 9am and came to lecture each time speaks to how incredible his lectures are. The only thing to watch out for is that the preceptors sometimes communicate the wrong due dates or instructions, so make sure you clarify all deadlines with Flaherty.But, that said, this course is fantastic and really added to my Princeton experience ? I would definitely recommend taking it!",,
"I have very mixed feelings about this class which should otherwise have been one of my all-time favorites at Princeton, given the great lectures and fascinating content. Professor Flaherty's lectures were amazing but were offset by the preceptors' disorganization and failure to communicate clear expectations for the exams. I hope that Professor Flaherty teaches this class again and exercises greater oversight of the administrative portions of the class. Professor Flaherty is a great teacher but delegated the operations of the course to the preceptors, who constantly messed up the most basic logistics (e.g., sent Canvas announcements with conflicting due dates, leaving us to guess and ask for clarification over and over again) and did not communicate clear expectations for the exams. There were frequently weeks with 300-350 pages of reading that no one completed in full (many people just opted out of the readings altogether because it was impossible to know which readings to choose to do, and the lectures were comprehensive). It would be more effective and respectful to assign 100-150 mandatory pages a week with the rest being optional and still listed on the syllabus for further reading.",,
"The readings are interesting and worth doing. The lectures might as well be a verbalized wikipedia page on China's foreign policy. They are general historical summaries that are great for anyone who knows nothing about China. The precepts are a total waste of time because the preceptors don't know how to run them. Hopefully, the instruction changes in the future because the material is fascinating and worth learning. Take this class if you know nothing about China and want an easy grade.",,
"This is one of the best classes I have taken at Princeton; Professor Flaherty is an incredible lecturer and the preceptors are great too - I really felt like I learned a lot. if you have any interest in China, you should take it.",,
Take this class! It is definitely a lot of material but it is so relevant for the World in the 21st Century. Prof. Flaherty and the preceptors are awesome!,,
One of my favorite courses at Princeton. Flaherty is an incredible lecturer and you can go from knowing basically nothing about China to becoming an authority on its foreign policy just by going to the lectures and taking notes. Way too many readings are assigned but most of what you need to know comes from lecture. It isn't too hard but if you try and stay engaged you'll come away knowing a lot about China,,
Great course! Take if you have an interest in IR and/or are thinking about entering the policy world after graduation.,,
"Try to do some of the readings every week, even though too many are assigned. Take notes in lecture and that should be fine for the midterm and final.",,
This course provides a good general overview about how and why China does what it does today. You learn the mistakes made by the US and the West that lead to this moment.,,
Do as many of the readings you can,,
"Stay on top of the readings, or divide them with others if you can.",,
"It's a genuinely great course, my favorite this semester! The readings are a lot, but don't let that discourage you!",,
"Take it, Professor Flaherty is great and the readings are instructive",,
"Highly recommend taking SPI 316 with Professor Flaherty, it is an exceptional course which offers a broad foundation for an understanding of Chinese foreign policy. This class will be highly illuminating both for students without any background knowledge and students who have a detailed understanding already, since it covers both breadth and depth in the topic. The lectures in particular are fantastic and Professor Flaherty does an exceptional job of bringing the material to life in relevant and engaging ways. Readings are copious, and judiciously choose which ones to spend time on, but midterm and final will fairly reflect the effort put in during both lecture (take good notes!) and outside of class.",,
Take it! Professor Flaherty makes 9am lectures bearable!,,
You learn a lot from this class especially if you don't have any background in China. Take for general interest,,
so useful and really interesting,,
All SPIA majors and ROTC cadets should take this course.,,
"Professor Flaherty is a great lecturer, but everything else was poor-fair. Too much reading per week, assignments graded harshly and late. Overall, this is a history class, we hardly talked about current and relevant Chinese foreign policy. I am not sure if that was to avoid talking about ""sticky"" subjects, but those are the exact topics that should be discussed in a Princeton classroom.",,
Do the readings and take good notes on lectures and readings.,,
"Interesting course but very disorganized. Beware of the readings. There is wayyyy more reading than the course description says. Wayyyy too much reading. If you want to take this class seriously, do not take it during a particularly busy semester because the reading quantity is out of this world.",,
"This is a great course. Professor Flaherty is a phenomenal professor and lecturer and his experience gives him a lot of great perspective and input for this course. I never take early classes and this was one I was more than happy to wake up for. Precept was also great, but be prepared to talk about IR theory and do a lot of readings. Lynn is a great preceptor!!",,
"If you want to learn the actual knowledge about diplomatic interactions, this is it. Prof. Flaherty knows and does a lot of spices you would have never imagined at Princeton.",,
"Take this class! Skim the readings, and summarize the authors' arguments throughout the semester, because it will help with the midterm and final",,
"Definitely worth taking, very engaging and not too difficult. Also very relevant",,
"Solid class overall. The material is interesting and super timely, and lectures were mostly engaging. The class was sometimes disorganized and precept was poorly run. There are probably better SPIA/SA classes out there, but this one was fairly easy and interesting most of the time.",,
"Professor Flaherty is very well-established in his knowledge of China, but the course is SO disorganized that I do not recommend taking. There were 250+ pages of reading every week, the lectures were not very helpful, and the precepts also did not provide much clarity for the confusion. You are better off taking another class.",,
"Take this class if you're looking for an introduction into Chinese history and politics in relation to the rest of the world. Very good survey class and a super relevant and important topic for anyone in SPIA, interested in international affairs, or just general knowledge.",,
If you are interested in China and its foreign policy take this course,,
Take it if you're interested! Skim the readings. Lecture is great,,
Keep on top of the readings,,
"I would highly recommend this course, as it presents the historical context to understand China's foreign policy, introduces many and varied perspectives on China,and provides plenty of opportunity for you to explore topics of your own interest, both on exams and papers.",,
If you have an interest in Chinese foreign policy then take this course. The readings are substantial but you will need to keep up. Go to lecture.,,
"Do the readings! They are a lot, but they give pretty interesting takes on China's foreign policy, and are very helpful for exams and written assignments. Lynn is also super helpful if you have her as a preceptor, so I really encourage you to go to her for help.",,
"You should take at least one class on China before you leave Princeton. It's such an important country and Prof Flaherty's class really gives you a groundwork to understand what's happening in the news with China today. The reading load is super intense (250-300 a week) so get a study group together to split up the readings. The midterm and final were both open note, open internet so were really not intense.",,
