Wouldn't recommend taking the course in a 5-course semester, as there is a lot of reading, which if you don't do will leave you completely stranded in class and in discussions (precepts essentially just discuss the readings in further detail). Office hours are a must, and if Nikhil is still precepting I found him to be very approachable and helpful. "Introductory but challenging" is how the course is described, but it definitely would've helped if I had taken something like a PHI202 or similar beforehand. That being said, Macedo is really knowledgeable, and you likely won't find a more charismatic lecturer in the SPIA department. Moreover, the weekly courseload outside of reading is very light, with most of the coursework centring around midterms and finals. Overall, taking for an EM?: there are far easier options. Taking for a SPI ethics core?: not a bad choice, but leave it for a 3/4 course sem to get the most out of it. I took this in a 5-course sem and ended up dreading class for what are very intriguing and interesting debates and challenges for our modern world</div>

This course has been my favorite by far in my time at Princeton. The readings are incredibly insightful and key to forming your own opinions for precept discussions. Regardless of your interest in the material, this class is an incredibly exercise in analyzing the arguments of others and working through you own thought processes to develop a clear and strong line of reasoning across disciplines.</div>

Professor Macedo is a really great and engaging lecturer and the class covers some really interesting topics. The workload wasn't too bad - weekly readings took me about 2-3 hours and there were only two papers, though there was also a paper for the final. Precepts were also really thought-provoking and engaging. Overall a great philosophical basis for thinking about policy and about government. </div>

Make sure you take good notes so that when you write papers you are able to save time and think more about the material/prompt. Four papers was overkill though. Peter was a great preceptor, definitely recommend. Course slides were helpful but Macedos lecturing can be confusing. Wish we went more in-depth into criminal justice. </div>

It is a ton of reading but it is incredibly rewarding! Be sure to go to office hours. This course will really make you think! Great class. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This course is a stellar example of what it means to self-teach at this school. I have learned a great deal in this course, but not because of the pedagogy by Professor Macedo or the preceptors. The material is engaging and has changed how I view policy and ethics, but we were left alone to teach ourselves a great deal of it. No one in this course has experience as a policymaker - any applications to 'policy' are poorly done.In practice, the lectures are essentially meaningless -- the readings are not reviewed in depth. Nearly all the lecture slides are quotes, but even so it is clear that the lecture slides are not his. The professor was dismissive in office hours, only learning the names of a select few students for the entire course and engaging solely with those who were in his precept, even in lecture. Even after an entire semester, he did not recognize most of his students. With that being said, Professor Macedo is a humane professor who tries to take student feedback into account. During a difficult semester, he did make an effort to reduce workloads. However, if you are a SPIA student, you will be better off taking another elective. </div>

Be aware though, in our semester that the readings for the second half of the semester weren't really posted ahead of time and were prone to changing. For a social science class, the readings were never too heavy. </div>

Overall, the course asks questions interesting to everyone, whether or not you're interested in politics!</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">TAKE THIS COURSE!!! This course teaches you so much about political theory and ethics. Then it asks you to apply these ideas to real life policy. It is FASCINATING. Of course, it's a substantial amount of work, but an A is attainable. </div>

Interesting in content, and nice balance between policy and moral aspects. Decent amount of readings and writing (2 papers and 2 essay exams), but professor and preceptor explain the important parts of the readings well, so no need to understand every aspect to do well on papers. Tackles complex yet relevant questions to the U.S., and professor breaks the various arguments down clearly, while encouraging discussion. Doable with no background in either policy or ethics.</div>

Even with his wealth of knowledge, he makes his student contributions in lecture and precept feel valued and meaningful. The topics and readings were interesting. It was fun going to lecture and discussing in precept. Made students feel welcomed with different backgrounds and conversations in precept felt comfortable. Take this class to fulfill SPIA requirement.</div>

Prof. Macedo is a great lecturer and if you can, enroll in Peter's precept! Covers a lot of really interesting topics and has pretty interesting writing assignments.</div>

The readings are fun too.</div>

I think it was interesting in terms of seeing different viewpoints and learning different frameworks of moral thought, there were just a few classes where I was kind of angry. That's not necessarily bad, but just don't expect it to be fair and balanced TMcr.</div>

I would say that this course did not capture that excitement as fully as it could have. There were a lot of precepts, and even lectures, where it would feel like the students were trying to "politicize the philosophy", and fit the philosophy into their own pre-determined beliefs, rather than trying to engage with the material from the standpoint of defining their own personal ethics. That however may not be the fault of Professor Macedo or the rest of the instructors. The instruction was very good and the readings were interesting. Maybe what I'm mentioning has more to do with the Princeton community than with this specific course, idk.</div>
