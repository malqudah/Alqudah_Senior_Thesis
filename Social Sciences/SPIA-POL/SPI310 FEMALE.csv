Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"Extremely easy class. I would describe it as a slightly more rigorous, more philosophical, version of AP Government. I was weary if I should take these to fulfill the Politics requirement for SPIA but am happy with my decision.",,
TAKE THIS COURSE!!,,
take this course; it is very informative and low workload,,
Make sure to do the readings.,,
Very broad course that does a good job covering lots of different topics in politics.  Good for a distribution requirement.,,
"As an international student, I really appreciated that the lectures covered the material with enough background and explanations that prior knowledge of American politics didn't feel necessary. The online lectures are incredibly clear and well structured, and do cover the important readings. I came out of the class having learned a ton. Try to get Stephanie as your preceptor! She is very insightful and takes notes of everything said during precept, including reading summaries, which was helpful at the time of studying for exams or putting together assignments.",,
"Prof Staszak is great! This class is a good intro to the department and to American Politics as a whole. It's not super engaging if you're not interested in politics, but overall, it's a good class.",,
I would recommend taking this course especially if it is prerecorded because it is very easy to fit into your schedule and it a very interesting course.,,
"SUPER RECOMMENDED--I never took AP Gov or APUSH but I found the course to be easy enough to understand, but difficult enough to be engaging",,
Beginning of this course is a bit boring if you have ever studied American history in detail. Prof Staszak's lectures on the Supreme Court and social change are incredibly interesting on the other hand. One of the best options for the politics requirement in SPIA. Workload is very light.,,
Watch lectures,,
loved taking this during an election and Stephanie is a great preceptor!,,
"This course was very straightforward and not too time-consuming. Some of the readings were interesting news articles, and others were more scholarly works that could be skimmed pretty quickly and were reviewed in lecture and precept anyway. Professor Staszak's pre-recorded lectures broke down the many different aspects of politics into very manageable themes and details, and precepts were a great opportunity to discuss any questions you have about politics and we spent some time discussing the election and covid. The paper and midterm were very fair and directly based on lecture and over-arching concepts from the readings. If you've already taken an American history of government course, some of the lectures may seem a bit repetitive, but if your looking for a survey-like class with a lot of background on how our government works while mixing in some details about current politics, this class is perfect.",,
"take for SPIA requirement! best option by far, Prof. Staszak really knows what she's talking about and helps create a solid base for what you need to know about American politics. not too much work and super interesting",,
"I recommend this course if you're interested in learning more about the perspectives surrounding the American political system. Professor Staszak was a great lecturer, and Dr. Bass was an amazing preceptor. I would honestly recommend that you also try to get into a precept with only a few people, because my precept had a nice sense of community with the five students we had.",,
"If you're taking as a required course, I recommend. I'd also recommend for general interest. I can imagine this class is a bit more exciting when not restricted to COVID regulations. Prof Staszak is incredibly sweet and really really smart.",,
"Its a very interesting class and Professor Staszak is a great lecturer. At times there will be a lot of reading, so prepare for those weeks in advance or just skim. Derek is an awesome preceptor! Take it with him if you can.",,
Good Class,,
Keep up with lecture and make sure to do all the readings.,,
"If you have to take this sort of course for SPIA or other requirements, I would say this is a solid choice. I did learn a lot, and the material was engaging, but if I'm being honest not enough to make the course truly enjoyable. There are probably other, more interesting courses you could take on similar subjects if you're just taking it for interest.",,
This class is great way to learn a more general and necessary view of politics.,,
"Have a strong understanding of the early readings so that you can use ample textual evidence in your essay. Overall, it was a very enjoyable course that informed my understanding of the political system.",,
Prepare to make connections between different readings,,
I would recommend keeping up with the readings each work and writing out drafts/key points for the discussion questions--this will be especially useful in preparation for the final/midterm and weekly precepts.,,
This class is amazing. Professor Stazach is an amazing lecturer and her presentation are clear and precise. You know what to expect for the papers and exams if you listen in class and participate in precept. Exams and papers were on par with the materials learned in class. Readings can be long but definitely very rewarding(will pay off in exams and papers). Preceptors were also amazing. Take the precept with Stephanie if possible! She is amazing and makes the class so much more engaging and easy to understand. Her precept notes were of great help over the whole course.,,
"Take it, Staszak is awesome!!",,
This is a great course if you want a general overview of US politics. The workload is manageable and Prof Staszak is wonderful,,
"I'd recommend it to other students, but would advise them to be wary of the essay prompts on the final exam",,
"A pretty easy PDF, though there are plenty of other classes you could take for that instead. The content is reminiscent of a high school gov class.",,
I would recommend getting a general knowledge about politics in our world.,,
This class helps you get a better understanding of the basics of American politics. It goes more in depth than high school government classes with thought provoking questions and engages in pretty interesting readings/recent events.,,
do the readings and keep track of them in like a google drive or something. the exams are closed book so when you're studying you gotta really learn the readings! also there is definitely something to gain from taking this course even if you know the basics about American government. stephanie is a good preceptor,,
Take this course if you want a good foundation for american politics.,,
Great course!! Really good intro to many facets of American political system. It was also exciting to see current news events being discussed in class. Prof. Staszak was a great lecturer and really cares about her students! Derek is an awesome preceptor who makes class engaging and gives great feedback on your writing. Definitely take if you're interested at all in American Politics!,,
"It's an intro politics course. Pretty superficial but in-depth enough to give you a better understanding of the American political system. The exams were fair and the essay was dense but relevant to the course. Pay attention in lecture, take notes if you can, and find a precept that is engaging.",,
"I really enjoyed taking this class. It ended up just being a course that I took out of general interest and I am so glad I did. The material was really interesting to learn about, especially in the midst of an election because I was able to bring a lot of my questions about current politics to this class and just expand my general knowledge of politics. In addition, the workload for the course was fairly low, but I still believe I gained a lot from the course. Highly recommend this course!",,
