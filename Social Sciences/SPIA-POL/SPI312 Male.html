Grading was also a little harsh. Lectures were always super interesting though, and Heather was an amazing preceptor. Take if you a strong interest, but definitely not an easy 5th class.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would give the strongest recommendation possible against taking this course unless you are an extreme masochist. This was by far the worst course I took. It singlehandedly made me no longer want to be a politics or SPIA major. The reading were an enormous waste of time, the assignments and midterm were unreasonable, and we were given little to no guidance on how to do most assignments even though it was supposed to be an introductory course and many of the students had never had to complete assignments that were anything like what was assigned in the class. While some of the information in the class was interesting, I don't think we learned as much as we should have and the entire experience was unreasonably stressful and time consuming. I spent between thirty and forty hours a week doing readings for this class and still almost never finished everything for the week. </div>

The lectures are a bit meandering and the readings can be dense, but more importantly the exams are poorly (and arguably vindictively) written. The midterm exam gave a prompt that could not be adequately answered in the space provided and was graded harshly despite this fact. The final exam tested relatively obscure and unimportant material, focusing on minute concepts with tenuous connection to international relations instead of the more important ideas or points.If Dr. Moravcsik is not teaching this course, then it may be worthwhile. If he is and you are interested in international relations, you are better off taking POL 396, POL 380, POL 388, or Introduction to Comparative Politics.</div>

With heavy reading loads, mandatory movies that you are tested on, and last minute precept assignments, sometimes it can be overwhelming. However, if you can stick it out and really engage with the material, it is worth it. You learn so much important history and develop different theories of IR that help you to think about conflict in various ways. I would recommend in a 4 class semester with light workload.</div>

His lectures are dry, the readings are unnecessarily heavy, and the grading is strict on writing assignments, making it difficult to get an A. The upper level international relations courses are better than this one, so just take International Organizations, Human Rights, or Grand Strategy instead.   </div>

Contrary to the course description, this class doesn't not feel like an introductory course. Do not take this course if you are taking other reading intensive courses. Expect to dedicate far more time to this course than any other course?even intensive seminars and language courses.Honestly, if you are trying to satisfy a core course for SPIA, pick a different one. The material in this course is interesting and I definitely learned a lot, but it wasn't worth the stress and overwhelming workload. If you're really interested in the concepts taught in this class, take a class where the material is presented better and the readings are less dense. Expect to be notified about precept assignments every week with little advanced notice (usually the day or two days before the assignment is due). If you want to get an A in the course, you're probably going to have to do all of the readings and define the hundreds of terms + dozens of study questions every week. Either that or you'll have to have a strong understanding of European history, economics and current foreign policy coming into the course to be able to finesse your way through it without selling your soul to this class. If you don't do all of the readings, you can probably do well on the essays (that's what I did), but you're screwed for the final closed book exam. Even if you do all of the readings, good luck memorizing all of the material. It's only 10,000 years of human history and over a thousand terms that you have to know - fun times!I've heard that the professor who used to teach this class was better than Moravcsik. Perhaps that's true. But my experience was not good.</div>

Constant lack of communication and lack of trust (essentially accused students that they would cheat so exam couldn't move online). An unbelievable amount of reading that is unnecessary (find the 3 important readings a week and do only those, dont worry about articles). Don't take this if you are just interested in IR, it is incredibly dry and reduces everything to broad statements that mean nothing. Avoid this course AT ALL COSTS, especially if Moravcisk is teaching.</div>

There is a lot of reading to do every week and the depth and breadth of the material that is covered is immense, so it might be somewhat time consuming</div>

The second half goes over many modern day problems in today's political landscape. There was a lot of readings each week, do them if you want to know what is going on. Lectures give an overview and does touch upon the reading's topics but the readings are pretty important. </div>

Professor Moravscik is very one-sided in his discussions and really teaches in a way that is entitled and as though he is better than everyone else. I struggled to grasp all the material we had for each week and was left way behind for exam week. </div>

I took this course my freshman fall, and the level of readings (100-150, sometimes nearly 200 pages) of dense text was difficult to manage. Especially if you want to close read or take notes, time simply does not allow you to do so. </div>

Keep in mind the whole first half of the class is basically a world history class. Professor Moravcsik is very knowledgeable, but he was one of the most unkind professors I've ever had here. He was not understanding of illnesses and left mean feedback on written assignments. He did not seem to care much about students' wellbeing. Between his attitude and the dryness of much of the material, I wish I had done a different SPIA departmental and I don't want you to make the same mistake.</div>

                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a fantastically well taught course. Professor Moravcsik is a great lecturer and Grace is an awesome preceptor. However, the readings are extremely heavy. The midterms are very fair but the final is brutal if you haven't prepared in the right way, so my advice is to: keep detailed notes on your laptop of how the theories can be applied to each historical event, write an adequate definition (a few sentences) for every single ID on the week you learn about it and keep track of them in a document or digital folder, and ask questions in office hours if you're confused about something because it might come up later. I didn't have much prior knowledge of world history prior to this and felt like it was a good intro. I would recommend this class for someone who's interested in international politics and has the time to invest in the course. I don't recommend it for people planning on doing a five-class workload.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">An interesting course but very theoretical and does not get into extreme detail on international issues. Precept was fun, but lectures and the overall operation of the course are not the greatest. you start this class learning about war and end it learning about how human civilization is ending as we know it, so it's just kind of depressing and not taught in an intriguing way. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Don't take it, you'll probably regret it. This course seems super interesting, and it was, but it was also very difficult. The readings seem random and sometimes irrelevant to the current content being covered, lectures moved much too quickly, and there was hardly any time given to complete complex assignments. The professor is very knowledgeable, but he is teaching this low level class like its a high level one. Would not recommend unless you absolutely have to take it.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Do not take. The reading load is crazy and is less helpful for exams than you'd think.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is an introductory course to international relations but involves a lot of challenging and time-consuming readings. The course applies theories of international relations to historical and current events in international relations. This course is especially suitable for someone with an interest in history. Professor Moravcsik is extremely knowledgeable and has a regional expertise in European affairs. Note that this course is challenging because it takes time to learn the theories of international relations and how to use them to interpret IR data (on historical and current events) in a way that focuses on the data rather than the theories, but the class is worthwhile and will help you learn about IR thought and better understand what is at stake in international situations and diplomacy.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would strongly recommend this course if you're willing to challenge yourself ? you don't need prior knowledge, but the rigor makes it feel more like a graduate-level IR theory class than an introductory class. Professor Moravcsik is a great lecturer and preceptor and I got to know him because I made an effort to go to his office hours. His passion for teaching combined with his prominence in the IR field made him one of the best professors I've ever had at Princeton. I feel like I got a lot out of the course because I put a lot of effort into it. We were cold-called on in precept, which was scary but forced me to do the readings, which I'm very grateful for because they were enriching. Professor Moravcsik is one of the most cited IR scholars of all time, so learning from him about other canonical IR scholars like Keohane, Mearsheimer, Kissinger, Diamond, and Kindleberger was a great opportunity. I loved the course but be aware that there's a ton of work during the semester: hefty readings every week, films during the second half, several partnered precept assignments, and two papers. If you take this class, it's an absolute must to get into Professor Moravcsik's precept and go to his office hours. In addition to him being an amazing teacher, my friends in the class with other preceptors did not like it. They worked extremely hard, received harsh grades, were very bored in precept, and got very piecemeal feedback on their work. The course was just as rigorous for me, but I was intellectually stimulated by and received proper feedback from Professor Moravcsik so I felt positively motivated to work harder and perform better during the semester. </div>

However, this was greatly subtracted from the fact that many of the readings were unnecessary and redundant which was frustrating considering the massive amount fo time required to do them. Additionally, the final exam is atrocious. It requires you to know pretty much every single thing about the course, which is an impossible amount of information, and there is so much to do that it's incredibly challenging to get it done in the time slot. I was incredibly diligent with doing every reading, attending the lectures (which were often challenging to engage with), discussion in precept, and studying for the exams; however, I will still likely not be getting even an A- in this course. If you aren't concerned with getting a lower grade, I'd consider it for the material, but not for the way the course is designed or because you think it will be easy. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">In fall 2021, this course was well-designed and relatively well-executed, but the workload was unreasonable. There were some weeks where we were expected to complete 150 pages of readings, a full-length film, prepare precept materials, and complete one of the two 1000-word writing assignments. Don't take this class unless you don't mind a B--I spent an inordinate amount of time on this course, and the borderline A-minus I had prior to finals was undone by the unreasonably difficult exam.   </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is an incredible class, and it will teach you a lot. However, the workload is high. The readings can be intense, with long and difficult texts. I would definitely recommend keeping up with the readings because they are important for the essays and final exams, and it's not easy to catch up if you get behind more than a week. Overall, a fascinating class you'll learn a lot from if you're interested in international relations.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This course is way more work than one would expect from an intro class. The rreading load is very high, and the lectures don't always synthesize excellently with the readings. Probably easier to take a higher level IR course, the only real takeaway from this was a basic understanding of 4 theories of international relations (realist, non-rationalist, liberal, informational). Beyond that, I didn't particularly benefit.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Do not take this course. It is an overwhelming amount of work with unrealistic expectations and harsh grading. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">Interesting materials and a lot of the readings were very enjoyable. The course itself was slightly unorganized and you never know where you stand grade-wise. Precept assignments are much more lowkey than you think they are and the written assignments/midterm aren't terrible. Identification terms for the final are utterly pointless...30 pages of terms yet will only be asked about 10 on the final?? Moravcsik is super knowledgable about what he's teaching plus plays music at the beginning of every lecture. Stay on top of the readings and they'll be manageable. He uses grade distribution.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would strongly recommend this course. While the written work can sometimes be daunting, the material covered and the general quality of the lectures more than make up for it. </div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I would recommend against taking this course solely due to the constant headaches to which its lack of organization and consistency contributed. However, it could be a good PDF just to learn a lot about international relations, but it is not possible to do all of the readings assigned. This course was one of the most disorganized, time-consuming, and unrewarding courses I've taken at Princeton. At the beginning of the year, Prof. Moravcsik said that he had lofty goals for the amount of material we could learn in a semester, and he was correct. These goals were not met. The amount of material discussed in lecture and assigned in reading was unreasonable, which prevented us from learning all of the topics well. We were given no help in understanding which material took priority, which also contributed to the lack of deep understanding of the course's topics. When it came to assignments for precept, the course staff had no regard for students' time and outside lives, and often assigned time-consuming written work a day or two before precept. This written work often focused on niche events that were not very important to the overall understanding of international relations. Throughout the semester, there was a huge gap between where the course staff thought we were and where we actually were in terms of understanding. I was in group chat of students in my precept as well as from other precepts, and we would routinely express our confusion about the topics and the expectations for our written work. The wording of assignments expressed lofty goals and expectations for the assignment, but the confusion and lack of understanding of the people in the group chat conflicted with this. There was also much confusion on whether it was more important to know details of the historical events we studied or more broad ideas of international relations thought. When it came to studying for the final, the preceptors sent huge lists of possible ID terms, and the lists' length rendered them nearly useless and contributed to confusion about what we should even be taking away from this course. There were also huge numbers of specific theories taken from readings, and it is not humanly possible to know all of them, yet that is what was expected of us. At the end of the day, I learned a lot from this course, but the amount I learned still pales in comparison to the amount of information they tried to teach, showing an organizational failure on the part of the course staff.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">This is a very interesting course if you are at all interested in International relations or need the credit for SPIA. The lectures are very interesting, but the class is very difficult. The readings are very long to get through, and the papers with the midterm, combines with last minute precept assignmets grew to be very stressful. </div>

This class is the hardest POL class that I've taken at Princeton (I'm a senior). The syllabus alone is 25 pages. While there's very little written work during the semester, the final will be a beast. There's over a 100 terms to memorize for each week, and over 100 pages of reading each week. If you have to take it, Heather was a great preceptor. Also the grading is really harsh, it seems as if there are few As given out.</div>
                                                            <div class="comment border border-dark p-2">I find the course material extremely interesting, and I read all of the readings, but I still found that the course attempted to cover more material than it could. This is a hard course to take at the introductory level, and I would recommend taking it after building a strong foundation in public policy analysis in a different course. </div>
