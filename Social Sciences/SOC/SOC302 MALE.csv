Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"I wouldn't have taken this if I didn't have to. It was really dry, the lectures were unengaging.",,
"Take this with Khan. I thought I would hate it but he is a good lecturer and made the material pretty engaging. Plus, the readings aren't egregiously long and were pretty well-selected.",,
Seek out help from either the professor or preceptor for the written assignments.,,
"For memos, chose theorists that you feel you understand the most to write about, otherwise completing good memos can be a big struggle. Use other resources outside of the readings given to help clarify more. Request visuals! Do not be afraid to ask questions.",,
Professor Khan is great but definitely would not recommend this class unless you are required to,,
Only take this course if you have to for the departmental requirement. It seems the quality of the course fluctuates based on the professor.,,
"Theory is not the most exciting sociology class, but Professor Khan is an engaging professor that makes theory more accessible to contemporary issues/times. He was quite unorganized, which sometimes made it confusing when trying to do readings or prepare for class. Overall, better than I expected though!",,
"ok class, lectures were just prof talking - would prefer slides; no work was graded but also those grades don't make/break our grade so it was chill; readings were pretty thought-provoking and a deeper dive into theorists i knew surface-level",,
Professor Shamus Khan is a great professor and is able to simplify difficult concepts with great ease. He is willing and available to answer questions about the course. Take this course,,
Shamus Khan is a big deal in the sociological world and is one of the leading figures in the field. I am grateful for the opportunity that I had to gain some understanding of social theories from the perspective of such a renowned sociologist. The class will certainly be engaging and interesting for you.,,
"I'm not sure how to feel about this course.  On one hand, I actually did enjoy the lectures, they were super interesting and professor Khan explained things in very interesting ways.  However, he had no notes or powerpoints or any way to review the material he presented besides the notes you would have to take in class. The readings were all famous sociologists so it was densse and very difficult to understand.  This class was challenging, but I am hoping that professor Khan gives us fair grades and doesn't overestimate the soc majors here.",,
"Not a super easy class. Take only if you have to, or if you like reading old dense texts.",,
Only take this course if you have to. You don't have to read every word of the readings but make sure that you get the main idea.,,
"You're probably taking this course because it's required; hopefully, they figure out how to make the course more engaging/cover more than 4-5 theorists total.",,
"not sure why you would take this if you did not have to, but it was relatively painless",,
