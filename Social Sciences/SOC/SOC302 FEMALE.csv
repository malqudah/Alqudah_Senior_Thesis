Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Professor Scheppele is awesome!,,
Scheppele is amazing and so is Shelby (the preceptor)!! Both Prof. Scheppele and Shelby made a class that is usually dreaded by soc majors into an engaging and insightful experience.,,
"Would recommend taking it with Prof. Scheppele if you can! She's a good, focused lecturer who breaks down difficult concepts well. Be strategic with the readings and try to get a sense for what's being prioritized each week. The amount of material on the syllabus represents a time management issue for both teaching staff and students, meaning that some readings get very little coverage in lecture or precept.",,
Professor Scheppele and Shelby made this class interesting. It's a ton of material and lots of reading but if you pay attention during lecture and participate in precept it's a pretty good class!,,
Put the work in and seek out the professor- the conversations with her honestly make the class,,

"INCREDIBLE. TAKE IT IF YOURE IN SOC OR NOT. IF YOU ARE IN SOC, TAKE SOC THEORY WITH PROF SCHEPPELE. Professor Scheppele is an absolutely brilliant lecturer. She is brilliant, passionate, engaging. Her knowledge is so extensive, her life experiences so interesting. She presented the subject matter incredibly clearly. Intellectual curiosity and independent thinking thoroughly stimulated. Best lecturer I have had at Princeton. I fell in love with sociological theory and might want to specialize in it in SOC grad school. The course was incredible. Every lecture somehow managed to stretch my thinking in significant ways. I learned so much about the social world, theorists, thinkers, how to write, how to think, how to learn, how to observe other human beings. The course should not be touched. It is perfection.The instructors were exceedingly clear in preparing us to do written work, with more guidance in the assignments themselves than I have received in any other course at Princeton. The course was extremely well-organized. I learned so much from the writing assignments, too, about the texts, but also more generally about making strong arguments and writing with precision. I would take the course again.",,
only take if you have to lol,,
SOC 302 with Prof. Scheppele is the best! would recommend any class with her,,
If you're interested in sociological theory at all this is a good survey. Professor Scheppele is so kind and cares about her students a lot.,,
Professor and preceptors are helpful and amazing.,,
"SOC majors have to take this course, but it really does provide an interesting way of looking at the world and Prof. Scheppele is a wonderful teacher!",,
i love the soc dept and prof Scheppele is very wise. good class with denser theoretical readings.,,
Make sure to do all of the readings and engage in the precepts.,,
"As someone who doesn't generally love discussing theory, I went into this course hesitantly. But Prof Scheppele & Shelby made the theory we read both accessible & topical! Don't take until you're sure you're SOC, though.",,
"Professor Scheppele is incredibly kind and understanding. She handled the transition to online learning so well. Even if she doesn't teach this class again, I'd recommend taking a different one with her since she's a really interesting person and a greater lecturer/professor to know. In terms of the class, the workload was manageable and fair although the readings were long and dense. However, all sociology majors have to take it and you do learn a lot along the way so don't let the breadth of the material discourage you.",,
"I'm not sure if Professor Scheppele (KLS) will continue to teach this course (it seems like the professor changes every year), but if KLS is teaching it, I'd highly suggest that you take this course if you're a SOC major. You're going to have to take it anyway, and KLS is an engaging lecturer with lots of interesting stories. Even more importantly, she showed a lot of care for her students, which was especially evident during this crazy semester. She was always willing to talk after and outside of class, and grading was very fair and reasonable.",,
This class is thought-provoking. Do take!,,
taking this class as a sophomore is 100% possible but it was a bit intimidating at first to be in a precept of juniors.,,
"Professor Scheppele is wonderful! And it will be much easier to get through the course if you get to know her and really engage with the material. Start the midterm and final far in advance, you will need the time.",,
"yes with scheppelle and Shelby, dooooo it.",,
"Take this course if you are interested in thinking critically and constructively about the way we understand society. Some important points: 1) You can take this course in Soph year, no need for prereqs, as long as you're sociologically minded (have taken a SOC course, the more philosophical/critical the better!) 2) Theory should be taken for more than just a departmental, this is some of the most fascinating content I've studied at Princeton. You'll learn why some people you've never heard of are really cool (Georg Simmel, Sara Ahmed, Joan Scott) and why people you've heard too much of are actually cool (Marx, Du Bois, Durkheim). 3) Professors for this class seem to vary a lot. 4) You'll unlikely manage all the readings, but they are the core of the class. Find a strategy: e.g. choose one text a week to read cover to cover and skim the rest/share notes with friends.",,
Do the readings and take notes during lecture!,,
take it!,,
