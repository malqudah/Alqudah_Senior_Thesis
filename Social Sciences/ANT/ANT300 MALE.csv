Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
Prof. Zee is a gift. Absolutely take his class! He makes you think and uses the assignments to let you think through ethnographic issues that matter to you.,,
"TAKE THE COURSE AND GET INTO JERRY'S PRECEPT! This is such a spectacular course and probably my favorite this semester. Jerry was such a great professor and felt like a real person I could connect with and ask for help, something I don't necessarily feel with all professors. One week when people hadn't signed up for his office hours on WASE, he sent an announcement out on Canvas for people to just come hang out and ask questions if they had any on Zoom. The readings were also phenomenal?I really want to finish reading a number of the books we read excerpts from this semester. We literally sat in the dark and read scary stories people wrote that used tools of ethnographic description during precept for Halloween week and regularly got to see Nancy, Jerry's dog. What more could you want from a course?",,
"this class is as much about Noticing people/places/things as much as it is about how ethnography becomes a way we move thru life - it reframed current things and made things that dont feel current current. jerry is so silly and i have never had a teacher so full of care and who constantly says thought provoking things while remaining easy to talk to/engage with. take his precept if u can, do the readings because theyre really good, this was probably the most important and engaging class ive taken at princeton and for it to do so as a REQUIRED, normally begrudingly-taken class is impressive and says a lot",,
Take this course! Jerry is an amazing human being who really makes you recontextualize ethnography in many different ways.,,
"Take this course, it is very chill, and you will learn a decent bit.",,
"A joy of a departmental, and if Anthropology at all interests you, I would highly suggest considering it. All three professors are humans that make you want to spend more time in their presence; this precept was very often the highlight of my school week. Advice: give yourself time to actually do the readings. You will enjoy them and wish you would have started sooner so you could read them in full.",,
"Professor Zee is an awesome person and lecturer. You can approach him and talk to him like an actual friend, which I think is rare with professors, and he'll actively listen to what you have to say, even if it's constructive criticism. Also, Mark is one of the best preceptors I've had so far. He's super patient and caring!",,
I mean take it if you have to,,
"I recommend taking this class even if you're not within the department or certificate program! The class material is very engaging, while shining light on current social and political issues. Professor Zee, Drury, and Collins are all amazing professors and are super willing to help you with independent projects and research. There is a normal load of reading, participation, and papers but is quite manageable in a 5-course semester. I would highly recommend!",,
This class will give a good introduction on how to be an anthropologist and is a manageable workload.,,
Do the readings!,,
"Professor Zee, Drury and Collins brought energy and passion to this class. The readings are unique and the most relevant I have read in any anthropology class so far. I do wish we could have discussed the readings in a more interactive fashion in lecture but overall great class.",,
Professor Zee really cares about students and wants them to enjoy the material and class. The readings are interesting but can get a bit dense at times.,,
this class is great!,,
"TAKE THIS COUESE WITH PROFESSOR ZEE! You will fall in love with him! I mean, the course!! This is the course that will give you a thorough introduction to what anthropology is and make you feel compelled to engage with the discipline further.",,
Come to class prepared. Do all the readings. Take notes sparingly. You don't need to write everything down.,,
I'd recommend this course. Jerry is super nice and all the preceptors are very helpful. I'd recommend contacting the professors with any issues or challenges with the material because they were very understanding.,,
"This is a course requirement for ANT concentrators and I believe those pursuing an ethnography certificate, but it was also great at helping me think about how research helps build worlds and is something that you can and should return to, while also being critical of the discipline itself. I highly recommend Professor Zee's course to anyone remotely interested in ethnography. Notetaking is helpful based on the readings, but lectures and precepts (I had Zee), are freeform and notes may not be the most helpful for them. Come prepared to talk, otherwise the Prof. might talk for a bit too long and you may feel lost, but just be free to ask questions, which Zee welcomes and goes out of his way to answer. Prof. Zee is super nice and understanding, so be free to talk to him about deadlines and topics you don't understand whenever.",,
I don't recommend taking this for fun. It's not a hard course but it isn't particularly interesting most of the time.,,
"I would recommend this course if you need to take it for the department. Without any background in Anthropology, it might be tough, but the professors and preceptors are helpful and responsive. Do the readings, that way you'll get more out of the lectures. Workload is very reasonable.",,
