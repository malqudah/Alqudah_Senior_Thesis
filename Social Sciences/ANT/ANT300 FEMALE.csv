Student Comments,,What advice would you give to another student considering taking this course?
"The course is fine, not painful and not particularly exciting. I mean, if you're taking this, you're probably either an Anthro major or getting the ETH certificate so it's required. If you're just looking to try out an anthro class for fun, there are definitely better ones. Weeky memos and journals are super short and manageable, the hardest part is literally just remembering to do them.",,
"For a departmental, it's not that bad. Just ask for feedback on how you're doing earlier on.",,
You're probably taking it because it's required. Professor Lederman is pretty dry but she's very friendly and is a lot more helpful in office hours. Precepts are decently interesting.,,
Make sure to attend precept,,
"You have to do the readings to be successful, so do them. Also, get to know the instructors and even your classmates because they are very invested in making you better and helping you with your independent work.",,
"Take it if you have to, otherwise, don't. If you have to take it, understand why it is important to study the material of the course for future ethnographic endeavours. The course is well-structured, the syllabus has everything you need to know, relax, and let go.",,
"If you're an anthropology or ethnographic certificate student, then it's going to be hard to avoid this course. I would say that for any students thinking of studying abroad during Junior Fall, please think ahead and take this course sophomore fall! If it's too late, then this course might be difficult to navigate after taking ANT301. Lectures are dry but precepts are more engaging. If you are at all confused about readings, please ask a preceptor to help you.",,
"This class was honestly not super exciting. The professor and the preceptors are wonderful and very helpful when you reach out to them, but the actual reading materials are very dry. As a pre-med majoring in anthropology, I found this course to be particularly challenging as my introduction to ethnography because it is very dense on readings and the language was new to me and difficult to understand. I think that much more interesting ethnographies could have been selected for this class. Long story short, take it if you need to. Grading is fair and pretty lenient, you will most likely get an A if you put in average effort; you shouldn't treat it like an easy class but you also shouldn't treat it as your hardest class.",,
Only take this course for the requirement. There are plenty of other introductory anthropology courses which are less stressful and teach the same concepts.,,
"This course can feel a little boring, but it is a great class to take if you are interested in anthropology!! Would recommend! Professor Lederman is very sweet and the content is interesting!",,
only take if required and hope professor lederman is not teaching it anymore,,
Do the readings. Participate in lecture and precept.,,
its will be helpful in the longrun,,
Be sure to do the readings and engage in precepts,,
"Be aware there is a lot of writing, but the reading material is actually good and helpful for independent work. Participate!",,
Do the readings and make sure build on key concepts from the course in your weekly memos and journals.,,

"This is a required departmental for Anthropology majors, which might be enjoyed only by the most hardcore as well. In spite of the deceiving cycle, it's truly an epistemology course investigating the why's and how's of ethnography. Unless you care deeply about Theory of Knowledge, I would advise against.",,
